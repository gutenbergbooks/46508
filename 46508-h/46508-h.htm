<h2>Preface</h2>


<p>Of all people in the world the Grecians did
most for art, and to the ancient Hellenes we
owe much that is beautiful in art and interesting
in history. Of modern Greece we know
but little, the country of isles and bays, of
fruits and flowers, and kindly people. So in
this story you will find much of the country,
old and new, and of the every-day life of Our
Little Grecian Cousin.</p>

<h2>Our Little Grecian Cousin</h2>


<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>ZOE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Zoe</span> sat in the doorway tending baby Domna
as she lay asleep in her cradle. She was sleeping
quietly, as any child should who has the
cross on her cradle for good luck. Her skin
was as white as milk, and this was because Zoe
had taken care of her <i>Marti</i>. On the first day
of March she had tied a bit of red ribbon
about her little cousin's wrist, for a charm. The
keen March winds could not hurt the baby
after that, nor could she have freckles nor
sunburn.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of April first, Zoe had
dressed the baby and carried her out of doors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
The dew lay over the flowers, the sun was just
up, and his rosy beams turned the blossoming
lemon trees to beauty. Zoe had sought the
nearest garden and there hung the <i>Marti</i> on
a rose bush, plucking a rose and pinning it to
Domna's cap.</p>

<p>"Now, Babycoula,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> she had said, clapping
her hands, "you shall have luck. Your <i>Marti</i>
is upon a rose bush kissed with dew before the
sun is high. The summer's heat shall not
touch you and you shall be cool and well."</p>

<p>It was fortunate for Zoe as well as for the
"Joy," which the Greek word for baby means,
that Domna was a quiet baby. As most of
the little girl's time was taken up with caring
for one or another of her aunt's children,
when they were cross it left her but little time
for thinking and dreaming. Zoe's thoughts
were often sad ones, but her dreams were rose-coloured.
When the little girl thought, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
remembered the home she had once had. It
was far in the sunny south where lemon groves
lifted golden-fruited arms to the soft winds,
and hillsides gleamed with purple and white
currants.</p>

<p>Her father had met with ill luck and men had
told him of a land beyond the seas, where
people had plenty to eat and found gold pieces
rolling in the streets. He had sent her mother
and herself to live near Zoe's uncle and she had
seen no more the bright, gay father whom she
loved. Then her mother died, and this, her
first great sorrow, made her into a quiet, sober
child with a dark, grave face. At ten she was
a little old woman, taking such good care of her
aunt's babies that that hard-working woman
did not begrudge the orphan the little she ate.</p>

<p>Uncle Georgios was a kind man. He loved
children, as do all Grecians, who say, "A house
without a child is a cold house." He worked
too hard to pay much attention to any one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
swarm which crowded his cottage. Aunt Anna
had so many children that she never had time
to think of any of them except to see that they
had food and clothes. Zoe was but another
girl for whom a marriage portion must be provided.
Every Grecian girl must have a dowry,
and it would be a great disgrace if none were
ready for her when she was sought in marriage.
Fathers and brothers have to earn the necessary
money, and the girls themselves make ready
their household linens, often beginning when
only ten years old.</p>

<p>Zoe had not commenced making her linens
because her aunt had not been able to give
her thread or even to take time to teach her to
spin. So the little maid's hands were idle as
she watched the babycoula and that was not
good, for a girl's fingers should always be at
work, lest she have too much time to think sad
thoughts. But, if her thoughts were dark, her
dreams were bright, for she saw before her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
rosy future in which she lived where the sun
shone and everyone was happy.</p>

<p>Baby Domna stirred in her cradle, for flies
were crawling over her little nose. Zoe waved
them off singing, "Nani, nani, Babycoula,
mou-ou-ou!" The baby smiled and patted her
hands.</p>

<p>"You are a good child," said Zoe. "The
best of tables was set out for you the third night
after you came from Heaven. There was a
fine feast for the Three Fates, even a bit of
<i>sumadhe</i> and a glass of <i>mastika</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> You must
have good fortune.</p>

<p class='poem'>
"Palamakia,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> play it, dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Papa's coming to see you here,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He brings with him <i>loukoumi</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> sweet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For Babycoula now to eat.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"It's time you went to sleep again, Baby,"
said Zoe, her foot on the rocker, but the babycoula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
gurgled and waved her fat arms to be
taken up, so the patient nurse took up the
heavy little child and played with her.</p>

<p>"Little rabbit, go, go, go," she said, making
her little fingers creep up the soft little arm, as
American children play "creep mousie," with
their baby sisters.</p>

<p class='poem'>
"Dear little rabbit, go and take a drink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Baby's neck is cool and clean and sweet,"</span><br />
</p>

<p class='unindent'>and the little girl's fingers tickled the warm
little neck and Domna laughed and gurgled in
glee. Zoe danced her up and down on her
knee and sang,</p>

<p class='poem'>
"Babycoula, dance to-day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Alas, the fiddler's gone away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He's gone to Athens far away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Find him and bring him back to play."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The pretty play went on, and at last the tiny
head drooped on Zoe's shoulder and the babycoula
slept again. Then her little nurse gently
laid her in the cradle, tucked in the covers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
sat slowly waving an olive branch above her
to keep away the flies.</p>

<p>Zoe's uncle lived in Thessaly, that part of
Northern Greece where splendid grain fields
cover the plains, a golden glory of ripened
sheaves.</p>

<p>Uncle Georgios worked in the fields in harvest
time and the rest of the year he was a shepherd,
herding sheep and goats in the highlands.
The boys worked with him. There were Marco
and Spiridon, well grown boys of eighteen and
twenty, working hard for their sisters' marriage
portions, which must be earned before they
themselves could be married. After Spiridon
came Loukas, a sailor, who was always away
from home, and then Maria and Anna. Another
boy, mischievous Georgios, was next in
age to Anna, there were two little girls younger
than she, and then Baby Domna, Zoe's especial
charge.</p>

<p>It had been a hard summer. The sirocco had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
blown from Africa and made the days so hot
that all field work had to be done at night.
Now the threshing-floors were busy and Uncle
Georgios was working early and late to get in
the grain.</p>

<p>"Zoe!" called Aunt Anna from within the
house. "It is time to take your uncle's dinner
to him."</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt," said Zoe, rising from the doorway,
and hastening to take the basket Aunt
Anna had prepared. There was black bread,
fresh garlic and eggs. Then she ran quickly
along the path which led to the fields. It was
a beautiful day and the air was fresh and
sweet.</p>

<p>"I am Atalanta running for the apple,"
laughed Zoe to herself, as she sped up the hill,
reaching the threshing-place just at noon.
The threshing-floor was very old and made of
stone. It was thirty feet across, and over its
stone floor cattle were driven up and down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
with their hoofs beating the grain out of the
straw. Zoe stood and watched the patient
creatures going back and forth yoked together
in pairs.</p>

<p>"Heu! Zoe!" called Marco, with whom she
was a great favourite, "Have you brought us
to eat?"</p>

<p>"I have, Cousin," she answered, gazing with
admiring eyes at the tall fellow, with his slim
figure, aquiline nose, oval face, and pleasant
mouth shaded by a slight moustache. Marco
was a true Thessalonian, handsome and gay.
He had served his time in the army and had come
home to help his father bring up the younger
children.</p>

<p>"Why don't you put muzzles on the oxen,
they look so fierce?" said Zoe, looking at the
great creatures as they passed and repassed.</p>

<p>"Oh, they are never muzzled," said Marco.
"It was not done by our fathers. It reminds
me of what I read in Queen Olga's Bible, 'Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the
grain.'"</p>

<p>"What is Queen Olga's Bible?" asked Zoe.
She was not afraid of Marco. With her other
cousins she was as quiet as a mouse, but she
chatted with Marco without fear.</p>

<p>"The good queen found that the soldiers had
no Holy Scriptures which they could read,"
said Marco. "Because all the holy books were
in the ancient Greek. She had them put into
the language we talk and printed for the
soldiers. Then she gave one to each man in
our regiment and I have mine still."</p>

<p>"How good she was!" cried Zoe. "Did
every one love her for her kindness?"</p>

<p>"Not so," said Marco. "Many people were
angry at her. They said she was not showing
respect to the Scriptures and was trying to
bring in new things, as if that was a sin! All
new things are not bad, are they, little cousin?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, it is long since I had anything
new," said Zoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true, poor child," said Marco,
kindly as he glanced at her worn dress. "Never
mind. When we get Maria married you shall
have something new and nice."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, I am very well as I am,"
said Zoe, flushing happily at his kindness, for
she was a loving little soul and blossomed like
a flower in the sunlight. "I must go home now,"
she said. "Baby will be awake from her nap
and Aunt Anna will need me to tend her."</p>

<p>"Are you never tired of baby?" asked
Marco.</p>

<p>"Oh, I love her," said Zoe brightly, as if
that was an answer to his question, and nodding
gaily, she took her basket and ran down the
hillside, where buttercups and bright red poppies
nodded in the sun.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>MARIA'S WEDDING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Maria</span> was to be married. This was a very
great event in the family and all the little Mezzorios
were wild with excitement. Maria was
the favourite sister, and she was tall and very
beautiful. Her hair and eyes were dark and her
smile showed through gleaming white teeth.
Her marriage chest was ready, her dowry was
earned, and a cousin of the family had acted as
"go-between" between Uncle Georgios and
the father of the young man who wished to
marry Maria. His name was Mathos Pappadiamantopoulas,
and he had seen Maria as she
walked spinning in the fields.</p>

<p>Generally in Greece the parents arrange the
marriages and the young people scarcely see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
each other before the marriage ceremony binds
them together. Maria's, however, was quite a
love match, for she and Mathos had grown up
together and had been waiting only for the
dowry to go to housekeeping in a little white
cottage near to that of her mother.</p>

<p>Mathos had often been beneath Maria's
window and had called his sweetheart all the
fond names he could think of. She was in turn
"cold water" (always sweet to a Grecian because
good water is so scarce in that country),
a "lemon tree," and a "little bird." He had
sung to her many love songs, among them the
Ballad of the Basil.</p>

<p class='poem2'>
"If I should die of love, my love, my grave with basil strew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And let some tears fall there, my life, for one who died for you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Agape mon-ou-ou!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Maria's <i>prekas</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> was a fine one. Her father
and brothers had determined that.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>"She shall not be made ashamed before any
man. If I never marry, Maria shall have a good
dowry," said Marco.</p>

<p>When the list of what she would give to the
furnishing of the little home was made for the
groom there was a strange array, a bedstead,
a dresser, a chair, sheets and pillowcases,
blankets and quilts. There were copper kettles
and saucepans of many sizes and shapes, and
the lovely homespun linens were beautifully
embroidered.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the wedding day,
Mathos' friends helped him carry the <i>praekika</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
from the bride's old home to her new one. Not
a single pocket handkerchief but was noted on
the list Mathos' best man had made, and it would
have been a disgrace to all the family of Mezzorios
had there been even a pin missing from
all that had been agreed upon when the match
was arranged.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>Musicians played the guitar and mandolin,
as Maria sat straight upright upon a sofa. She
was a little white and frightened, but looked
very pretty in her white dress embroidered in
gold, her yellow embroidered kerchief over her
head. Zoe, with the other children, had been
flying around the room ready, whenever the
<i>mastiche</i> paste was passed on a tray, to take a
spoon from the pile and gouge out a taste of the
sweet stuff.</p>

<p>"Maria looks lonely," she said to Marco.
"I'm glad I'm not in her place."</p>

<p>"She'll be all right now," he said as the cry
"He comes!" was heard outside. Zoe ran
to the door. She had never seen a wedding in
Thessaly and was very curious to see what it
was like. Little Yanne Ghoromokos was coming
up the street carrying a tray on which rested
two wreaths of flowers and two large candles
tied with white ribbon. Behind him was
Mathos, looking very foolish, surrounded by
his friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall not marry a man who looks like
that," said Zoe to Marco, who stood beside her.</p>

<p>"What is wrong with him?" asked Marco,
who liked to hear his little cousin talk, her
remarks were so quaint and wise.</p>

<p>"He looks very unhappy, as if this were a
funeral," she said, "or as if he were afraid of
something. When I marry, my husband shall be
glad."</p>

<p>"That he should be," said Marco smiling,
and showing his white teeth.</p>

<p>Mathos meanwhile made his way into the
house and sat down on the sofa by Maria. He
did not look at her, for that would have been
contrary to etiquette, but over the girl's face
there stole a warm and lovely colour which made
her more beautiful than ever.</p>

<p>All the men present looked at her and all the
women, old and young, kissed the groom, and
each woman made him the present of a silk
handkerchief. Then it was time for the wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
ceremony and Zoe's eyes were big with wonder.</p>

<p>On the table were placed a prayer book, a
plate of candies, as the priest, old Papa Petro
took his stand near by. Maria came forward
with her father and Mathos and his best man
stood beside her. To the child's great wonder
and delight, Zoe was to be bridesmaid, for
Maria had said to her mother,</p>

<p>"Let Zoe be bridesmaid. It will please her
and she is a good little thing." And Aunt Anna
had answered,</p>

<p>"What ever you want, my child."</p>

<p>Zoe, therefore, in a new frock, with a rose
pinned in her black hair, stood proudly beside
Maria at the altar. She watched the queer
ceremony in silence. First Papa Petro gave
the groom a lighted candle and asked him if
he would take Maria for his wife; then Maria
received a candle and was asked if she would
take Mathos for her husband, after which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
priest sang the <i>Kyrie Eleison</i> and made a long,
long prayer.</p>

<p>He blessed the two rings laid on the tray
before him, giving one to the bride and one to
the groom. The best man quickly took them
off the fingers of each, exchanged them, and put
the bride's on the groom's finger, giving his to
her.</p>

<p>Papa Petro next put a wreath on the head of
each and the best man exchanged them, and
the ceremony continued, but of it Zoe saw
little. She was so overcome by the sight of
Mathos' red, perspiring face, surmounted by
the wreath of white blossoms, and looking silly
but happy, that she had all she could do to keep
from laughing.</p>

<p>She was so astonished a moment later that
she nearly disgraced herself, for the rest of the
ceremony was like nothing she had ever seen
before. The priest took the hand of the best
man, he took that of the groom, and he held his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
bride by the hand, and all, priest, best man,
groom and bride, danced three times around the
altar, while the guests pelted the dancers with
candies, and Zoe stood in open-mouthed amazement,
until Marco threw a candy into her
mouth and nearly choked her. Then the ceremony
was over and everybody kissed the bride
and her wreath, which brings good luck.</p>

<p>"What do you think of being bridesmaid?"
asked Marco.</p>

<p>"It is very nice, but I was afraid I should
laugh," answered Zoe. "What do they do now,
Marco?"</p>

<p>"Maria must go to her husband's house.
She is starting now. Come, let us follow."</p>

<p>They went with the bridal couple down the
village street, and at her door lay a pomegranate.
Upon this the bride stepped for good fortune
with her children. Then Mathos' mother tied
the arms of the two together with a handkerchief
and they entered their own home. They drank a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
cup of wine together and turned to receive the
congratulations of their friends.</p>

<p>"Marco, it is your turn next. Beware lest
a Nereid get you," said Mathos, laughing.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of a Nereid," said Marco
hastily crossing himself.</p>

<p>"Once I saw one upon the hillside when I
was watching the sheep," said an old man.
"She was so beautiful I crept up to seize her
in my arms and behold! she turned into a bear
and then a snake. The bear I held but the
snake I let go. Then I saw her no more."</p>

<p>"Upon the river bank of Kephissos," said
an old woman, "dwell three Nereids. They
are sisters. Two are fair but one is ugly and
crippled. My mother lived there and she has
often told me that she heard the fays talking and
laughing in the reeds along the shore. The
pretty sisters like children and love to play with
mortals. Sometimes they steal away little folk
when they have stayed out at night in disobedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to their mothers. They take them
to their home in the reeds, but the lame sister
is jealous of pretty children and when she is
sent to take them home, she pinches them. My
mother has with her two eyes seen the black
and blue marks of pinches upon the arms of
children who did not always stay in the house
after dark. And where my mother lived they
say always to naughty children, 'Beware! the
lame Nereid will get you!'"</p>

<p>"Be careful, Zoe," said Marco. "Be a good
child and keep within when it is dark, else you
shall see the Nereid."</p>

<p>"God forbid!" said Zoe, quickly crossing
herself, "I should die of fright."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE ANTIQUE CUP</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Fall</span> had come with its cool, sunny days and
Aunt Anna was cooking beans, symbols of the
autumn fruits in honour of the old Feast of
Apollo. Olive branches were hung over the
door of the house to bring luck, as in the olden
times olive boughs hung with figs and cakes,
with jars of oil and wine were carried by youths
to the temples. Upon the hillsides the vineyards
hung, purple with fruit and winter wheat was
sown in the fields.</p>

<p>Zoe had begun to go to school and the babycoula
wept for her. She did not at all believe
in education since it took away her willing slave
and devoted attendant, but in Greece all children
are compelled to go to school and learn at least
to read and write and do simple sums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Zoe enjoyed the school very much. She
liked the walk in the fresh morning air and she
liked to learn, but most of all she liked the stories
which her teacher told whenever they were good
children, stories of the days when Greece was
the greatest nation of the earth, her women were
famous for beauty and virtue, her men were
warriors and statesmen.</p>

<p>She learned of Lycurgus, the great lawgiver,
of Pericles, the statesman, of Alexander, the great
general, and of the heroes of Thermopylæ. All
these tales she retold to her cousins and many
were the hours she kept them listening spellbound.</p>

<p>"It was not far from here, the Pass of Thermopylæ,"
she said. "Some day I shall ask
Marco to take us there. The story tells of how
Leonidas was king of Sparta and the cruel
Persians came to conquer Greece. Xerxes was
the Persian king and he had a big army, oh,
ever so many times larger than the Grecian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Well, the only way to keep out the Persians was
to keep them from coming through the Pass of
Thermopylæ, so Leonidas took three hundred
men and went to hold the Pass. For two days
they held it, and kept the Persians from coming
in, and they could have held out longer but for
treachery. A miserable man, for money, told
the Persians a secret path across the mountains,
so they crept up behind the Grecians and
attacked them. When Leonidas found they were
surrounded, he made up his mind that he and his
men must die, but that they should die as brave
men. They fought the Persians so fiercely that
the Pass ran with blood and several times the
Persians fell back; others took their places, but
these too turned back, and the Persian king
said,</p>

<p>"'What manner of men are these who, but
a handful can keep back my whole army?' and
one of his men replied,</p>

<p>"'Sire, your men fight at your will; these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Grecians, fight for their country and their
wives!'</p>

<p>"But at last the end came. Leonidas fell,
covered with wounds, and without him his men
could withstand no longer. One by one they
fell, each with his sword in hand, his face to the
foe, and when the last one fell, the Persians,
with a great shout, rushed through the Pass over
the dead bodies of the heroes."</p>

<p>"That's a fine story," said Georgios. "But
I sha'n't wait for Marco. I shall go to see the
Pass for myself."</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Zoe. "You must not. Aunt
Anna would be angry. It is quite too far and
it is in the mountains; you might meet a brigand."</p>

<p>But Georgios said only, "Pooh! I can take
care of myself," and looked sulky. It was
rather hard for Zoe to look after him. He was a
mischievous boy, only a year younger than she
was, and he thought himself quite as old. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
did not like it at all when his mother told him
to mind what Zoe said and often he did things
just to provoke her. This particular Saturday
he was in bad temper because he had wished
to go to the mountains with Marco and his
brother would not take him.</p>

<p>"Another time I will take you," said Marco.
"But to-day I am in haste. Stay with the girls
and be a good little boy."</p>

<p>"Stay with the girls!" muttered Georgios.
"It is always stay with the girls. Some day
I will show them I am big enough to take care
of myself."</p>

<p>So he felt cross and did not enjoy Zoe's stories
as much as usual.</p>

<p>"Not long ago," said Zoe, for the other
children were listening with rapt interest,
"some shepherds were tending their flocks on
the hills and one of them dug a hole in the
ground to make a fire that they might cook their
food. As he placed the stones to make his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
oven, he saw something sticking out of the
ground and leaned down to see what it was.
It looked like a queer kettle of some kind and he
dug it out and examined it. He cleaned the
dirt from it and it turned out to be an old
helmet, rusted and tarnished, but still good.
He took it and showed it to the teacher in the
village and he said it was very, very old and
might have belonged to one of Leonidas' men.
So the master sent it to Athens and there they
said that it was very valuable, and that the
writing upon it showed that it had been at
Thermopylæ. They put it in the great museum
at Athens, and paid the shepherd a great many
<i>drachmas</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for it, so many that he could have for
himself a house and need not herd sheep for
another man, but have his own flocks."</p>

<p>"Wish I could find one," said Georgios.
"I heard my father say we needed money very
badly. There are so many of us! I wish I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
big!" and the boy's face grew dark. Zoe's
clouded too.</p>

<p>"I am but another mouth to feed," she
thought; but Aunt Anna's voice, calling them
to come to the midday meal, put her thoughts
to flight.</p>

<p>It was not until after the little siesta they all
took after luncheon that she thought of what
Georgios had said.</p>

<p>"How I wish I could find something of value,"
she thought to herself. "I am not of much use
except that I try to help with the children. Oh,
I wonder what Georgios is doing now!" she
thought suddenly. She could not hear him
and when Georgios was quiet he was generally
naughty.</p>

<p>"Where is Georgios?" she asked the children,
but they did not know. Only little Anna had
seen him and she said that he had run quickly
down the road a little while before.</p>

<p>"You must stay with the babycoula here on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the door step," Zoe said to the little girls, calling
to her aunt within the house, "Aunt Anna,
I am going to find Georgios, he is not here."</p>

<p>"Very well," said her aunt, and Zoe set off
down the road. "Georgios!" she called.
There was no answer, but she thought she saw
the tracks of his feet in the dust of the road.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has gone to the river," she said
to herself, "to try to fish," and hastily she ran
to the bank but there was no little boy in a red
tasselled cap in sight. She hurried back to the
road.</p>

<p>"I am afraid he has tried to go and see the
Pass," she thought. "It would be just like him,
for he said he would not wait for Marco. Oh,
dear! I must find him. Aunt Anna will think
it my fault if he is lost or anything happens to
him." She hurried onward, calling and looking
everywhere but found not a trace of the naughty
little boy. It seemed as if he had disappeared
from the face of the earth, and she murmured
to herself,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>


<p>"Oh, if he has gone to the river and a Nereid
has stolen him! Perhaps he has run to the
mountain and a brigand has found him! I
must bring him home. Good St. Georgios,
who killed the terrible dragon, help me to find
your name-child! Oh, dear, of course the saints
hear us, but it would be ever so much nicer if
they would answer!" she thought. Then she
had little time to think more, for her whole mind
was bent upon finding the naughty boy whom,
with all his naughtiness, she dearly loved. She
hurried up the hill, peering under every bush,
behind every tree, beginning to think that perhaps
something had happened to the child.
She went on and on until the shadows of twilight
began to gather and she grew more and
more frightened. Beneath her on the mountain-side
flowed a little stream and she peered into
its silver depths wondering if perhaps Georgios
could have fallen into it. Then in her eagerness
she leaned too far, lost her balance and fell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Down, down she tumbled, rolling over and over
on the soft grass until she reached the bottom
of the hill. She lay still for a few moments
then sat up and looked about her.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 354px;">
<img src="images/i045.jpg" width="354" height="500" alt="hillside" />
<div class="caption">"SOMETHING LAY THERE HALF COVERED WITH EARTH."</div>
</div>

<p>She was in a spot in which she had never been
before, a pretty little glen, where the silvery
stream ran over white pebbles with a soft, murmuring
sound. Ferns grew tall and green,
delicate wild flowers bloomed among them,
the air was fragrant with the pines which grew
overhead, and the whole spot was like a fairy
dell. She tried to rise, but frowned with pain,
for she had hurt her foot. So she sat thinking,
"I will rest a minute and then go on and find
Georgios."</p>

<p>As she sat thinking she noticed a queer place
hollowed out by the water. Something lay there
half covered with earth and she stooped to see
what it was.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall find something like the
shepherd did," she thought, but with sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
disappointment she found that the object which
had caught her eye was but a queer little cup
black with red figures around the rim, and with
two handles, one at each side. It had the figure
of a woman at one side and Zoe thought it rather
pretty.</p>

<p>"It is not of any use," she said to herself,
"It is but someone's old cup. But I shall take
it home for the babycoula to play with. She
will think it is nice." So she tucked it into her
pocket and got up to go. Her ankle hurt but
not so badly that she could not walk. She wet
her kerchief and tied it around the swollen joint
and climbed up the hill which she had rolled
down so unexpectedly. At the top she stopped
and called as loudly as she could, "Georgios,
Georgios!"</p>

<p>An answering shout of "Zoe!" came from
below and her heart gave a glad leap. She
turned her steps downward and Marco met her
ere she was half way down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Child, what are you doing here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Is Georgios found? I came to seek him!"
she cried.</p>

<p>"He was not lost, that bad boy!" said Marco.
"When I reached home I found my mother
disturbed in her mind because you had disappeared
and the little girls said you had gone
to the mountain to find Georgios. Him I found
by the river fishing and he said that you had
called but that he had not answered. He will
answer the next time," and Marco's voice told
Zoe that he had made it unpleasant for Georgios.
"Then I came on to seek you. Poor child!
you must have had a hard climb."</p>

<p>"Oh, I did not mind," said Zoe. "Only I
fell and hurt my ankle. I am glad Georgios
was not lost. He might have answered me,
though," and her lip quivered.</p>

<p>"He was a bad boy," said Marco, "and
did it just to tease you. Let me see your ankle.
It is badly bruised, but not sprained, I think.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Come, I will help you home," and he put his
arm around her.</p>

<p>It took Zoe some time to get home for walking
on the lame ankle tired her and often Marco
stopped her to rest.</p>

<p>"What is it you have in your hand?" he
asked her, as they sat down to rest beneath
a giant fir.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is nothing," she said. "Just a queer
little cup I found and thought Baby Domna
might like to play with."</p>

<p>"Let me see it," said Marco, and he examined
it carefully. "Where did you find it?" he
asked at length and Zoe answered,</p>

<p>"When I fell by the river it lay in the dirt.
Is it too dirty for the babycoula?"</p>

<p>"Zoe," Marco looked strangely excited. "I
believe this old cup is of great value."</p>

<p>"Oh Marco!" the little girl could say no
more.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I may be mistaken, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
I think it is very old and that it is like some
cups I saw in Athens. They were sold for many
<i>drachmas</i>. They were black like this with a
little red on them, in lines and figures, and with
two handles. A man in my regiment said they
were of ancient pottery and that they were dug
up out of the earth. He said the museum at
Athens paid good prices for such things."</p>

<p>"Oh Marco!" Zoe's eyes were like stars.
"If it would only turn out that this was worth
something, even a little, how happy I should
be! I want money so badly."</p>

<p>"What do you want it for?" Marco looked
surprised.</p>

<p>"To give to Aunt Anna, of course," said Zoe,
surprised in her turn. "Georgios said to-day
that your father needed money and Aunt Anna
needs many things." The child said it so simply
that one would have supposed she never needed
anything for herself, and Marco caught her
hand with a sudden impulse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are a strange little one," he said. "If
this turns out to be worth any money, you shall
have it all to spend, every cent."</p>

<p>"For whatever I want?" asked Zoe in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Marco.</p>

<p>"Then I shall buy a dress for Aunt Anna
and for each of the little girls a new one that has
not been made over from someone's else. And
something I shall buy for each one of the family,
most of all for the babycoula, since I meant to
take the cup to her. And all the rest I shall give
to Uncle Georgios, for I am such an expense
to him."</p>

<p>"That you are not," said Marco. "My
mother said but yesterday that she did not know
how she would ever get along without you."</p>

<p>"Did she really?" Zoe's face flushed with
pleasure. "My foot is much better, we must
go on now, it grows so late."</p>

<p>So they hastened home and Zoe met a warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
welcome, even Georgios hugging her and saying
he was sorry he had sent her on such a wild
goose chase. Her cup was displayed and
wondered at, and later, when Papa Petro sent
it to a priest in Athens and he sold it for many
<i>drachmas</i>, Zoe was delighted and insisted upon
giving the money to her uncle for all of them to
share. Many comforts it brought for the family,
besides paying the debts which had been worrying
her uncle. And mischievous Georgios said
airily,</p>

<p>"It was all due to me that the cup was found;
for, if Zoe had not gone to find me, she would
never have fallen down the hill on top of it."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Marco sternly, "do
not let me catch you playing any such tricks
on your cousin again, or you will find something
not so pleasant as antique cups. She's too good
a little girl to tease."</p>

<p>And Zoe said in her soft little voice, "Oh,
Marco."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE "AGIASMO"</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Maria</span> had a little son. Mathos was almost
beside himself with delight, and the young
mother was beautiful in her happiness. Her
pretty face, always sweet, took on a deeper
loveliness as she gazed on the little creature, so
pink and white and dear, and Zoe thought she
had never seen anything sweeter than her cousin
and the baby together. Zoe had cared for her
Aunt's babies so well that she was quite an authority
and Maria trusted her with the little
treasure when she would look anxiously at
anyone else who took him up. He was indeed
a joy. Serene and healthy, he lay all day, quite
happy in the fact that he was able to get his tiny
thumb in his mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/i055.jpg" width="353" height="500" alt="Priest on donkey" />
<div class="caption">"PAPA PETRO CAME RIDING DOWN FROM HIS HOUSE ON A TINY DONKEY."</div>
</div>

<p>Maria had made her visit at Church on the
fortieth day after the baby was born and Papa
Petro had taken the little angel in his arms and
walked thrice around the altar with him. Now
the time had come when the good old priest
was to christen the baby, and all the relatives
and friends assembled to see the ceremony.</p>

<p>Papa Petro came riding down from his house
on a tiny donkey. He was a dear old man with
a wise, kindly face. He had been all his priestly
life over the one parish, and his people were
dear to him. They in turn loved him devotedly
and he was always welcomed joyfully at any
festivity.</p>

<p>Before the christening he blessed the house,
performing the <i>agiasmo</i> or blessing, with great
earnestness. First he took off his tall hat and
let down his hair which was long and snowy
white and usually worn in a knob at the back
of his head. Then he set a basin of water and
some incense before the <i>eikon</i> which was hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in a corner of the room. Every Grecian home
has its <i>eikon</i> or picture of a saint or the Blessed
Virgin. The incense he placed in a bowl and
lighted it, the smoke rising and filling the room
with a strong perfume. He read the prayers
which keep off the evil spirits in an impressive
manner, and then turned his attention to the
christening.</p>

<p>Baby Mathos, very cunning in his new cap,
was set down before the <i>eikon</i> which bore the
pictured face of the saint to whom he was to be
dedicated. That was the signal for all the
women present to rush for his cap, the one who
secured the coveted bit of lace and muslin being
the godmother. Zoe was the lucky one, and she
stood proudly up beside Maria and the godfather,
who had been Mathos' best man. The
<i>nounos</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> had given baby his fine new dress and
had come prepared for all that a godfather
must do.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>The babycoula was then undressed and held
up to the priest in Zoe's proud arms for Papa
Petro to cut three hairs from the tiny head and
throw them into the baptismal font. This was
filled with water into which the godfather had
poured a little olive oil.</p>

<p>Baby Mathos was then held to the west, to
represent the kingdom of darkness, and Papa
Petro asked three times, "Do you renounce the
devil and all his works?" To this the godfather
replied, "I do renounce them." At
this the priest and godfather turned toward the
east with the baby and the baby was plunged
three times into the water. Baby squealed and
kicked, and Zoe smiled, for if a baby does not
cry at the water it is very bad luck, showing that
the Evil One has not gone out of him. The
babycoula did his little best to assure the company
that he had no evil spirit left within, howling
wrathfully after he was dried and anointed
with holy oils, refusing to stop even when prayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
over at length, only smiling when, the ceremony
over, the <i>nounos</i> gave some <i>drachmas</i> to his
parents and threw a whole handful of <i>lepta</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
among the children present.</p>

<p>"He is generous with his witness money,"
whispered Zoe to Maria and she smiled happily.</p>

<p>"Our little one will have the best of godparents,"
Maria said sweetly. "You to love
him and Loukas to think of his welfare."</p>

<p>Papa Petro dipped an olive branch in holy
water and sprinkled the rooms of the little
cottage, then he sat down beside Maria, tied up
his hair and took a cup of coffee. Everyone
was served to glasses of water and sweets and
everybody talked and laughed and said what a
beautiful little Christian the babycoula was!
As each one admired the baby Maria coloured
and looked anxious and fingered the blue beads
about her darling's neck.</p>

<p>"What have you for a charm against the evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
eye?" asked Papa Petro, kindly. "Ah, I see,
the blue beads. Well, that is good. Blue is the
Blessed Virgin's colour and the Panageia<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> will
be your help. However, I have brought you a
bit of crooked coral which I have always found
good."</p>

<p>"It is most kind of you," said Maria prettily,
as she hung the precious spray of coral at the
babycoula's throat. Zoe smiled to herself. She
had not intended to run any risk that her
cousin's little baby should be marked with the
evil eye, which can be put on a child just by
admiring it. So, for the baby was so pretty she
had felt sure it would be admired all day, she
had put a bit of soot behind his ear, for that will
ward off any evil eye. It is a sure charm.
Therefore she felt quite satisfied even though
every one present did say that the baby was
perfectly beautiful. Then she held the little
thing up before a mirror, for that would insure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
another baby in the family before the close of the
year, and as the Grecians love children dearly
they are glad to have many of them.</p>

<p>The baby had so many pieces of white stuff
given to him that the little house looked as if it
had been in a snow storm. No polite person
would come to see a new baby and not give it
something white, even if it were only an egg,
for such a gift insures to the infant a lovely
fair complexion.</p>

<p>Thus was Baby Mathos started on his journey
as a Christian with all good omens, and his little
godmother went home in the cool of the evening,
happy in all of the pleasures of the day.</p>

<p>"It was lovely, Aunt Anna!" she said to her
aunt. "Was it not? Maria's baby is a dear
little fellow. He is my own godchild and I love
him dearly, but of course not more than our own
babycoula," and she buried her face in Baby
Domna's neck. The baby crowed and cooed
and patted Zoe's face with her tiny chubby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
hands and pulled her hair and acted in the entrancing
way in which only a baby can act and
Zoe laughed back at her and hugged her tight.</p>

<p>"You're my own babycoula," she said. "And
I love you better than anything."</p>

<p>"Better than you do me? Oh shame!"
said Marco teasing, while Aunt Anna, like every
other good mother pleased with the attention her
baby received, smiled upon her. Marco, however,
looked very solemn and said reproachfully,</p>

<p>"I thought you would never like any baby
better than me!"</p>

<p>"But you are not a baby," said Zoe, and
Aunt Anna said,</p>

<p>"I am not so sure that he is not. But do not
mind him, he is only teasing. You are a good
child, Zoe," and little Zoe went happily to bed
her heart warm at the thought that everybody
seemed to love her, if she was an orphan and far
away from home.</p>

<p>"It is only love that counts," she murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to herself sleepily and fell asleep with a smile on
her face, as the silver moon streamed through
her window and the air came in soft and kind,
fragrant with the breath of spring.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>A VISIT TO MARCO</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter passed quietly to Zoe and spring
came with its glories of cloud and flower and
sunshine. Men began to plough in the fields
with quaint old-fashioned, one-handled ploughs,
drawn by great strong oxen. Snows still crested
Ossa and Pelion, and beautiful Olympus, in
snow-crowned grandeur golden in the morning's
glow, turned to rose in the evening sunset.</p>

<p>Marco had gone far up the mountain side to
herd for a rich farmer who had many goats.
He watched the herds all day and, when they
were safely housed for the night, camped in a
rough little hut on the hillside.</p>

<p>Zoe missed him from the cottage, for of all her
cousins she most loved Marco. She was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
happy therefore when her Aunt Anna told her
one day that she might carry a basket of food to
the mountain.</p>

<p>She started off happily, running along the
village street into the open country, going more
slowly up the hillside, where the early wildflowers
were beginning to bloom.</p>

<p>She reached the little hut where Marco slept,
nearly at sundown but he was not there, so she
sat down to wait for him. The sun was streaming
in a golden glory and the Vale of Tempe
opened before her as fair as when the god Apollo
slept beneath its elms and oaks, wild figs and
plane trees. Zoe loved everything beautiful and
she sat and looked eagerly at the lovely scene.</p>

<p>"It is almost as pretty as my own Argolis,"
she said aloud, and then gave a little sigh.</p>

<p>"Still homesick, little one?" Marco's voice
said close behind her, and she sprang to her feet
in astonishment. He seemed to have sprung
from the ground, so quickly had he come upon
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Marco!" she said. "I did not hear
you come. I am so glad to see you. It has been
lonely at home without you."</p>

<p>"I have missed you, too. It is good of you
to come to see me," he said.</p>

<p>"Aunt Anna sent me with fresh cheese and
eggs and bread for your supper," she told him.
"This is a beautiful place isn't it, Marco?"</p>

<p>"It is indeed," he answered. "Like a fine
old man, Mt. Olympus always has snow upon
his head. See how the clouds float about the
summit; you know that was the home of the
gods in the old days. 'Not by wind is it shaken
nor ever wet with rain, but cloudless upper air is
spread about it and a bright radiance floats over
it.'"</p>

<p>"Papa Petro says we must not talk of the gods
of olden times, for they were heathen," said Zoe
primly. "But they were interesting. Where
did you learn so much, Marco?"</p>

<p>"It is not much I know," he said with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
laugh. "But when I was in Athens I took
service with a man from America. He knew
much. He read ancient Greek and when I told
him I was a Grecian from near Mt. Olympus,
he asked many questions about Thessaly and
the way we live here. In return he told me much
of our Ancient Grecian stories. He told me of
Jason and his adventures after the Golden
Fleece, of Perseus and Theseus and many
others."</p>

<p>"Tell me some of them," demanded Zoe
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, Perseus was the son of Danae, and a
god was his father. He was taller and stronger
and handsomer than any of the princes of the
court and the king hated him. But Pallas
Athene, the beautiful goddess of wisdom,
loved him and helped him and took him under
her protection. She gave him a task to perform,
to rid the land of the horrible Gorgon Medusa,
whose hair was a thousand snakes and whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
face was so horrible that no man could look
upon it and live. That Medusa might not kill
Perseus, Athene gave him a magic shield and
told him to look into the shield and seeing there
the Gorgon's image, strike! He was to wrap the
head in a goat's skin and bring it back. She
gave him also Herme, the magic sword, and
sandals with which he might cross the sea and
even float through the air. They would guide
him, too, for they knew the way and could not
lose the path.</p>

<p>"So Perseus started out, and he flew through
the air like a bird. And many were the dangers
which he met, but all he overcame. Far was
the journey, but he made it with a light heart.
He went until he came to Atlas, the giant who
holds the world on his shoulders, and of his
daughters, the gentle Hesperides, he asked his
way. And they said to him, 'You must have
the hat of darkness so that you can see but not
be seen.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"'And where is that hat?' he asked. And
Atlas said to him,</p>

<p>"'No mortal can find it, but if you will
promise me one thing, I will send one of my
daughters, the Hesperides for it.'</p>

<p>"'I will promise,' said Perseus. 'If it is a
thing I may do.'</p>

<p>"'When you have cut off the Gorgon's head,
which turns all who see it into stone,' said
Atlas, 'promise me that you will bring it here
that I may see it and turn to stone. For I must
hold up the world till the end of time, and my
arms and legs are so weary that I should be glad
never to feel again.' So Perseus promised, and
one of the Hesperides brought him the hat of
darkness, which she found in the region of Hades.
Then Perseus went on and on until at last he
came to the Gorgons' lair. And he put on the
hat of darkness and came close to the evil
beasts. There were three of them, but Medusa
was the worst, for he saw in the mirror that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
head was covered with vipers. He struck her
quickly with his sword, cut off her head and
wrapped it in the goat's skin. Then, flying upward
with his magic sandals, he fled from the
wrath of the other two Gorgons, who followed
fast. They could not catch him, for the sandals
bore him too swiftly. Remembering his promise
he came to Atlas, and Atlas looked but once
upon the face of Medusa and he was turned to
stone. They say that there he sits to this day,
holding up the earth. Then Perseus said farewell
to the Hesperides, thanking them, and he
turned away toward his home.</p>

<p>"He flew over mountains and valleys by sea
and land for weary days and nights. As he came
to the water of the blue Aegean sea, there he
found a strange thing, for, chained to a rock,
was a maiden, beautiful as day, who wept and
called aloud to her mother.</p>

<p>"'What are you doing here?' demanded
Perseus, and she answered,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Fair youth, I am chained here to be a
victim to the Sea God, who comes at daybreak
to devour me. Men call me Andromeda, and my
mother boasted that I was fairer than the queen
of the fishes, so that the queen is angry and has
sent storm and earthquake upon my people.
They sacrifice me thus to appease her wrath.
Depart, for you can be of no help to me and I
would not that you see the monster devour me.'</p>

<p>"'I shall help you, and that right promptly,'
said Perseus, who loved her for her beauty and
her sweetness. So he took his sword and cut
her chains in two, and he took her in his arms
and said,</p>

<p>"'You are the fairest maiden I have ever
seen. I shall free you from this monster and
then you shall be my wife.' And she smiled
upon him, for she loved him for his strength and
for his brave words.</p>

<p>"The sea monster was a fearful beast. His
jaws were wide open and his tail lashed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
waters as he rushed toward the maiden. She
screamed and hid her face, but Perseus dropped
down from the rock, right on the monster's back,
and slew him with his gleaming sword. Then
Perseus took Andromeda and flew to her home,
and her parents received him with joy, giving
him their daughter and begging him to stay with
them. That he could not do, because of his
promise to Pallas Athene. So he took his bride,
and her father gave him a great ship and he returned
to his mother like a hero, with his galley
and much gold and treasure, the marriage
portion of Andromeda. The wicked king was
not glad to see him and would have had him
killed, but Perseus held up to him the head of
Medusa and it turned the king to stone. Then
Perseus reigned in his stead, and one night in a
dream Pallas Athene came to him and said,</p>

<p>"'You have kept your promise and brought
back the Gorgon's head. Give back to me the
sword, the sandals, the shield and the hat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
darkness, that I may give each to whom it belongs.'
And when he awoke they were all
gone.</p>

<p>"Then he went home to his own land of Argos
and there he lived in happiness with Andromeda,
and they had fair sons and daughters, and men
say that when they died they were borne by the
gods to the heavens, and that there one can still
see, on fair nights of summer, Andromeda and
her deliverer Perseus."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Zoe, with a long drawn
breath of delight. "What a lovely story! But,
Marco, why don't people do such brave things as
that now days?"</p>

<p>"There are just as brave men now as there
were in the old times," said Marco, his eyes
kindling. "In my regiment they tell a story of
a Grecian soldier in our War for Independence.
Beside him marched a comrade, a man from his
own island. They had played together as boys
and had always been friends. But the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fellow had married the girl whom Spiro loved,
and he had a sore heart about that. The regiment
was up in the mountains and was attacked
by the Turks and Spiro's friend captured. Spiro
wept, but that was not all. He went to his
captain and begged that he might be sent to the
Turks in exchange for his friend. His captain
said it was impossible, that the Turks would not
accept him in exchange, but would kill both.
Spiro said, 'My captain, if they did accept
me it would be well. Let me go.'</p>

<p>"'You are a silly fellow,' said the captain.
'I cannot give you any permission. If you
can get word to the Turks and they will accept
you, then you may go.' This he said because
he was sure the Turks would but laugh at such
an idea of Spiro. But Spiro thanked him with
tears of joy. Then he went to a man in the
regiment who could write. 'Will you write a
letter just as I say it?' he asked and his friend
said that he would. Here is the letter,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>"'To the most noble general of the Turks,'
it began,</p>

<p>"'I am Spiro Rhizares of the &mdash;&mdash; Grecian
Infantry. I salute your Worship. You have
captured a man of my regiment, one Yanne
Petropoulas. He is a better man than I am but
I am good enough to kill. I am taller than he
so there is more of me to die. He has a wife and
I have not, so there is more need for him to live.
Wives take money; he should not be killed, for
then there is no one to buy bread and garlic
and embroidered kerchiefs for Evangoula. She
is a good wife, but even good women must have
loukoumi and coloured kerchiefs to keep them
good. I ask you therefore to have the great
kindness to kill me, <i>Effendi</i>, in place of Yanne,
and I think he would not object. If therefore,
your Worship will consent send me word, but
do not speak of it to Yanne, since he might feel
a disappointment that he might not die for his
country at your most worshipful hands. Asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
your Graciousness to send me word when I shall
have to the pleasure to be killed, I sign myself,
through the hands of a comrade, since I am too
ignorant a fellow to write (you see I am fit only
to kill),</p>

<p>"This letter Spiro sent through the mountain
passes by a shepherd boy and awaited an answer.
At last one came. It was short.</p>

When you are dead your friend shall go free.
This on the honour of a Turk. I promise because

<p>"Spiro was like a fellow mad with joy. He
sent all his money to Evangoula, gave his things
to his comrades, and, lest he be hindered, stole
off in the night. He reached the Turkish camp
and smilingly asked to die quickly that Yanne
might quickly go home. But the Turks had
other ideas. They tried to buy Spiro to talk
about his regiment and tell secrets of the army,
promising that both he and his comrade should
live, but he said only that he came to die and not
to talk, and they could get nothing out of him
though they tried in many ways. So at last they
cut off his head and set Yanne free. He was in
a terrible rage. He said that he never would
have consented had they told him. But they
only laughed at him and set him outside the
camp. And he came back to the regiment, but
he was not happy. He grieved for Spiro and
made himself ill. Then the captain spoke with
him. He told Yanne that Spiro had died for
him and that now he must make the life that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Spiro had saved of some account. His time in
the army was nearly up. He should go home
and care for his wife and thus do what Spiro
would wish.</p>

<p>"'This will be the only way to win happiness,'
said the captain. 'For if you do not
do this, your wife will say that Spiro was the
better man and that he should not have died,
but you.' And Yanne wept, but he did what
the captain had said. And that is the end of the
story. But all the regiment drink to the eternal
health of Spiro Rhizares, the hero."</p>

<p>"Oh, the brave splendid fellow!" cried Zoe.
"Indeed, he was as poor, as Perseus. That is
the nicest story I ever heard. Thank you so
much for telling it to me.</p>

<p>"How did there come to be war with Turkey,
Marco?"</p>

<p>"That is a long story, child, but one that you
should know. Once, you know, Greece included
Macedonia and all the strip of land along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
sea as far as Constantinople. But the Turks
always wanted Greece and in the year 1453
they came down upon us in a frightful war and
took the land. The Turkish rule was horrible.
Their rulers knew nothing but to wring money
out of our poor people and many Grecians fled
to the mountains and became <i>klephts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> These
fought always against the Turks and kept ever
within them the spirit of freedom. At last they
formed the Hetaeria, or Revolutionary Secret
Society, and soon Greece was fighting for her
independence. Such terrible battles as came;
such heroes as there were! It makes one want
to shout at the very name of Marco Bozzaris,
who surprised the Turks one night at Karpenisi
and overcame them.</p>

<p>"Our people fought like the ancient heroes,
but they could not get money to carry on the war.
The Turks brought in hordes of soldiers; Greece
was plundered and burned; people starved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the roadside, women and children were murdered.
At last the nations of Europe said that
such things could no longer be, and they joined
together to compel the Turks to allow Greece
to be free. This the Turks did not wish to do;
but France, Russia and England compelled
them to permit Greece to have her own government.
The Turks gave us back a part of our
country and a king was chosen to reign over
us.</p>

<p>"This was better than belonging to Turkey,
but it was not enough. We wanted all the land
that belonged to us and this we could not get.
The island of Crete especially wanted to be
Grecian but the Turks would not let it
go.</p>

<p>"At last in 1897, came the war in Macedonia,
in which our poor soldiers were shot down by
the hundred and we had to turn our backs
upon the foe. It was then that Spiro Rhizares
fought and died, and many, many splendid fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
as brave as he. It was a terrible war,
Little One. War is easy when a man marches
toward the foe. He is never tired or hungry
or footsore. But when he is ordered back and
must march away, his knapsack grows heavier
at each step; he is hungry and cold and weary,
and his heart is within him like lead. Our men
could have fought like heroes and Macedonia
would now be ours; but the orders came always,
'Retreat! Back to Velestino!' and what
could they do?</p>

<p>"The Powers forbade the Turks to conquer
further, or we might be slaves again. Never
mind, the day will come when every Grecian
shall arm himself, and the detestable Turks
shall be swept from our borders and all Greece
shall once more be free!"</p>

<p>Marco's eye kindled and his face flushed.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much for telling me about
it, Marco, I hope you'll never have to go to
fight, but I wish Greece could have all the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
that belongs to her. I am afraid I must go now.
Aunt Anna will be displeased if I am late. It
is growing dark. Are you not afraid all alone
here in the mountains?"</p>

<p>"Afraid of what, Little One?" asked Marco,
his hand on the hunting-knife which he carried
in the soft sash at his waist. "You see I am
not alone, I have a good friend here."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you might see a bear or a brigand!"
she said. "Oh, Marco, what is that?" A
tall figure appeared as she spoke from out of
the rocks above them. "It is a brigand I am
sure!" she whispered and clung close to her
cousin.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he answered. "Nobody ever
sees brigands now, Zoe," but as he spoke he
tightened his grasp on his dagger and put his
arm around his cousin, for every Grecian knows
there are brigands in the mountains of Thessaly,
though they are much less frequently seen than
they used to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Zoe gave a frightened gasp, "It is, I know
it is! <i>Pana yea</i>,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> save me!" she said as the
stranger approached, but Marco said pleasantly,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stranger replied to Marco with "Tee

<p>"Kala,"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Marco said briefly, and the stranger
said,</p>

<p>"It is late for you and your sister to be on
the mountain. She is a pretty child."</p>

<p>"Na meen avosgothees,"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> whispered Marco
to Zoe, then to the stranger, "Not later than
for you."</p>

<p>"But I have business here," he said with a
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">"STOOD BEFORE THEM IN THE BEAUTIFUL NATIONAL COSTUME OF GREECE."</div>
</div>

<p>"And so have we," and Marco's tone was
a little curt.</p>

<p>"My business is to eat supper," said the
man. "Will you join me?"</p>

<p>Marco was surprised, but Zoe whispered,
"Do not make him angry," so he said,</p>

<p>"Thank you. Zoe has brought me to eat
also. Will you not share with us?"</p>

<p>"We will eat together," said the stranger,
so they seated themselves upon the green grass
and Marco took from the basket Zoe had
brought, black bread and cheese for all three.</p>

<p>"This is the best I have, but I am glad to
give," he said, for he thought to himself,
"He has not a bad face now that one sees him
close. In any case it is best to be civil, for
bees are not caught with sour wine."</p>

<p>The stranger threw aside his cloak and
stood before them in the beautiful national
costume of Greece. Zoe thought that she had
never seen anything so fine as his clothes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
He wore a white shirt, a little black jacket
and <i>fustanellas</i>, the full white petticoat reaching
to the knees, to which Grecian men cling
in spite of the fact that it can be soiled in ten
minutes while it takes a woman almost as
many hours to make it clean again.</p>

<p>He carried a leather bag over one shoulder,
and from this he took a parcel, seating himself
beside Zoe and opening it with a gay
smile.</p>

<p>"I did not think this morning, when I had
this put up, that I should eat it with so dear a
little girl," he said. "Perhaps I should have
put in Syrian <i>loukoumi</i> had I known that you
would be here instead of <i>halva</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and <i>tarama</i>.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Should I not?"</p>

<p>"<i>Halva</i> is very nice," said Zoe shyly. "And
I have never tasted <i>loukoumi</i> of Syria."</p>

<p>"Have you not? Poor child! Tell me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
where you live and I will send you a packet
of it."</p>

<p>"I live in Karissa, near to Volo," said Zoe
with a sweet smile. "The gentleman takes
too much trouble."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly do it," he said, "unless
I am wrestling with Charos."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>"When your soul shall be a Petalouda<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and your dust shall become myrrh," said Zoe.
"On the third day I shall carry raw wheat
and a candle to Papa Petro, that he may
say prayers for you."</p>

<p>"You are an angel of a child!" there were
tears in the man's eyes. "It matters little
when Charos comes, since God sends Charos
to take souls. It is well if we leave behind us
some grateful hearts to say 'may your dust
become myrrh.' Come, let us eat. Here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
a bottle of <i>resinato</i>,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> bread and <i>tarama</i>, with
olives and garlic and <i>halva</i> for dessert. It is
a feast for the gods, yet the best Christian may
eat it in Lent."</p>

<p>They ate, the two men chatting together,
Zoe listening in silence. It had been long since
she had seen such a feast, for bread and eggs
were often all that was to be had in her
aunt's house, and sometimes there were no
eggs.</p>

<p>They sat beneath a giant tree on a carpet of
maiden-hair fern; scarlet anemones and heath,
orchids and iris bloomed beside them, and the
silver tinkle of a waterfall came softly through
the evening air. The fragrance of violets was
there, and a few early asphodel raised their star-like
blooms toward heaven.</p>

<p>"There is no place in all the world like
Greece," said the stranger, as he looked down
over the beautiful valley. "It was near to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
here that Cheiron's cave lay, and one can almost
see Olympus, home of the gods."</p>

<p>"Who was Cheiron?" asked Zoe.</p>

<p>"Do you not know the story of the Golden
Fleece?" said the stranger. "Shall I tell it
while we eat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you only would?" cried Zoe, and
he began.</p>

<p>"Long, long ago, when the gods lived on
Olympus, there was a cave in the depths of
old Mount Pelion and it was called the cave
of Cheiron, the Centaur. Cheiron was a strange
being, half horse and half man, for he had the
legs of a horse but the upper part of his body
was that of a man. He was wise and kind and
men called him 'the Teacher.' Many men
sent their sons to him to be taught, for he knew
not only all the things of war, but music and to
play the lyre, and of all the healing herbs, so
that he could cure the wounds of men. Among
his pupils was a lad named Jason, whose father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
was Æson, king of Iolcos, by the sea. The
wicked brother of Æson had cast him forth
from his kingdom, and fearing that Jason
would be killed, the father left the lad with
Cheiron. Cheiron taught him much, and he
learned quickly. He learned to wrestle and
box, to ride and hunt, to wield the sword, to
play the lyre, and even all that Cheiron knew
of healing herbs Jason learned. Jason was
happy with Cheiron and loved him, and the
youths who dwelt in the Centaur's cave, these
he loved as brothers. He was quite content
until one day he looked forth over the plains
of Thessaly to the south, and as he saw the
white-walled town beside the sea, something
stirred within him, and he said to Cheiron,</p>

<p>"'There lies my home. Now I am grown,
I am a hero's son, let me go forth and take my
heritage from that bad man who cast forth
my father, for I know that one day I shall be
king in Iolcos.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"'That day is far, far away,' said Cheiron,
who could read the future. 'But it will come.
Eagles fly from the nest, so must you fly hence.
Go, but promise me this. Speak kindly to
each one that you meet and keep always your
promises.'</p>

<p>"'I promise you and I will perform,' said
Jason, and he bade Cheiron farewell. Then
he hurried down the mountain-side, through
the sweet-smelling groves where grew the wild
thyme and arbutus, beyond the vineyards
green in the sun, and the olive groves in fragrant
bloom. He came to the river bank, a
stream swollen with spring rains and foaming
to the sea. Upon the bank was an old
woman, wrinkled and gray, and she cried to
Jason,</p>

<p>"'Good sir, carry me across this stream.'</p>

<p>"Jason looked at her, and at first he thought
to leave her, for the stream was broad and it
roared over cruel rocks and was heavy with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
mountain's melting snow. But she cried pitifully,</p>

<p>"'Fair youth, for Hera's sake, carry me
across.'</p>

<p>"Now Hera was queen of all the gods who
lived on Olympus, and Jason said,</p>

<p>"'For Hera's sake will I do much. Cling
upon my back and I will carry you across.
That I promise you.' Then he remembered
Cheiron's word and was glad he had answered
her softly. He struggled through the foam,
but the old woman was heavy and she clung
about his neck and seemed to grow heavier.
He buffeted the waves and struggled, and
twice he thought he must let the old woman
go, but he remembered his promise and held
her fast, and at last he reached the farther
shore and scrambled up the bank. And as
he gently set his burden down, lo! she was a
fair young woman, and she smiled upon him
and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I am that Hera for whose sake you have
done this deed of kindness. I will repay you,
for whenever you need help call upon me,
and I will not forget you.' Then she rose up
from the earth into the clouds, and with awe
and wonder, Jason watched her fade from his
sight.</p>

<p>"Then he went on to Iolchis, but he walked
slowly, for he had lost one sandal in the flood.
He went into the city and spoke with the king,
demanding his realm, and the king was afraid
of him, for soothsayers had foretold that a
man wearing one sandal should take the kingdom
away from him.</p>

<p>"But the king spoke to him kindly and gave
him food, and said to him, 'Your father gave
me the kingdom of his own free will. See him
and ask him if this is not true.' Jason said
that he would do so, and he ate with his uncle,
and at last the king said,</p>

<p>"'There is a man in my kingdom whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
I am afraid will cause me trouble if he stays
here. What would you do with him were you
I? I ask because I know you are wise.'</p>

<p>"'I think I would send him to bring home
the Golden Fleece,' said Jason.</p>

<p>"'Will you go?' said the king, and Jason
saw that he was caught in a trap, and that his
uncle had meant him.</p>

<p>"'I will go, and when I return I will take the
kingdom,' he said, and straightway he made
ready. He made sacrifice to Hera, for in those
days people killed a lamb in honour of the gods,
as we to-day burn a candle at a shrine. Then
he fitted up a ship and sent word to all those
princes who had been with him in Cheiron's
cave that they come with him on this glorious
quest. And they came and all the youths set
forth upon a mighty ship. Of the many things
that happened to them I have no time to tell,
but at last Jason came to the shores of Cutaia,
where the Colchians lived. There was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Golden Fleece, but guarded so that no man
might take it. There it had been for many
years, since King Phrixus had slain the Golden
Ram and offered it in sacrifice, and since then
all the world had longed to possess the wonderful
Golden Fleece.</p>

<p>"Medea, the king's daughter, saw Jason, and
loved him because he was fearless and brave.
She was a witch and she helped him with her
witchcraft, giving him a magic salve with
which he rubbed himself so that no weapon
could hurt him, and his strength was as the
strength of mighty hills. He who would possess
the Fleece must first wrestle with two terrible
bulls, then he must sow serpent's teeth in a
ploughed field. From the teeth sprang up a
field of armed men, and these must be overcome,
and then the deadly serpent which
guarded the Fleece must be slain. All these
things Medea's magic helped Jason to do. He
fought with the bulls and conquered them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
he harnessed them to the plough and ploughed
the field. He hewed down the armed men as
if they were stalks of wheat and last of all he
sought to slay the serpent. Orpheus, who had
been with Jason in Cheiron's cave, went with
him to the tree where hung the Golden Fleece.
He was the sweetest singer in all the world,
and he played soft and sweet upon his lyre
and sang of sleep, and the serpent closed his
eyes and slumber stole upon him. Then Jason
stepped across his body and tore the Fleece
from the tree, and he and Orpheus and Medea
fled to the ship and away they sailed to Greece
again."</p>

<p>As he finished a sudden sound reached their
ears and Marco sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"A wolf is at my goats!" he cried. "I
must go. Zoe, fly quickly down the mountain;
but no&mdash;it is too late for you to go alone, there
are wild beasts abroad. You should not have
stayed so late!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go quickly to your goats, Marco. That
is your duty. I shall be safe, for I shall pray
to the saints and the Holy Virgin, and I shall
run very fast."</p>

<p>"Go to your herd, good shepherd, and I will
take your sister home," said the stranger, putting
up the remains of his meal, but Marco
did not look reassured. He looked helplessly
from one to the other. "I may be out all night,"
he said, when another squeal, sharp and shrill,
came through the air.</p>

<p>"Go at once, Marco, I shall be quite safe
with this gentleman," said Zoe.</p>

<p>"I will promise that she shall go straight
home," said the stranger, and Marco unwillingly
turned to the mountain.</p>

<p>Zoe and her strange companion walked
hastily down the steep path which led to
the village.</p>

<p>"Child," said the stranger, "why did you
tell your brother to go? Are you not afraid
of me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is not my brother, but my cousin, and
I am not at all afraid," she said.</p>

<p>"But you were afraid at first," he said.
"You thought I was a brigand."</p>

<p>"That was before I had seen your face,"
said the little girl. "And now that I have seen
you and heard you talk, I know that you are
not."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You are a good man, because you keep
the Lenten fast, you speak well of God and you
are kind to a little girl. So I know you have
a white heart. You may perhaps be a brigand,
but you are a good one."</p>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"You are a strange little one," he said.
"Tell me your name."</p>

<p>"I am Zoe Averoff, of Argolis."</p>

<p>"Zoe Averoff of Argolis! Child, what are
you doing here?"</p>

<p>She looked at him in wonder as she answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
"My mother is dead, my father is gone and
comes no more; he must be dead too. I live
here with my uncle, the father of Marco."</p>

<p>The stranger's eyes were fixed upon her and
she saw them fill with hot tears.</p>

<p>"Child," he said, "I believe you are my
little niece. I am Andreas Averoff, and your
father was my brother. I feared that I would
fail to find you, since all they could tell me at
your old home was that you had gone to Thessaly.
Do you remember me, since I went to
your house once long ago?"</p>

<p>"I know that I had an Uncle Andreas,"
said Zoe, scarce believing her ears. "But I
do not remember him."</p>

<p>"I am that uncle," he said, "and I have
come to take you with me to my home. I
have a wife and son in Argolis, but our little
girl we lost. Will you come and be our daughter,
or are you too happy here?"</p>

<p>"I am not too happy," said Zoe, "but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
would be hard to leave Marco. He is so good
to me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps your Marco will come with us,
for I have money and we can find him better
things to do than to fly to the mountains with
the shepherds each St. George's Day. Now,
take me to your home and tell your aunt what
has come of your taking tea with a brigand."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>ZOE TAKES A JOURNEY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next few days seemed to Zoe to pass
as in a dream. So many things happened which
she had never supposed could come to her,
that she was almost dazed. Uncle Andreas
was such an energetic person that he carried
everything his own way. He silenced all objections
to his plans, and before the child fairly
knew what was happening she had said good-bye
to her Thessalonian relatives, and with her
new-found uncle and Marco was sailing out
of the harbour of Volo on her uncle's ship. She
wept a little at leaving her cousins, especially
the babycoula, but that Marco was to be with
her robbed the separation of half its sting.
The future opened before her with much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
interest. Unknown lands were to be explored,
and to Zoe this in itself was charming.</p>

<p>"Do you feel as if you were setting out to
find the Golden Fleece?" asked Marco as
the two sat upon the deck and watched the hills
of Thessaly fade in the distance, as they sailed
over the blue Gulf of Velos.</p>

<p>"I feel very strange and full of wonder as
to what will come next," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, Little One," said Uncle Andreas'
hearty voice, "what kind of a sailor are you
going to make?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I like it on the sea," she answered
brightly. "When we came to Thessaly, Mother
was very ill, but I was not at all. I love the
salt air, the spray and the feel of the wind on
my cheek. It is like a kiss."</p>

<p>"Good girl," her uncle smiled at her. "You
are just the one to have a sailor uncle. Many
a fine sail shall we have together when we reach
our own Argolis. Marco shall be a fisherman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and we three shall sail and sail in the roughest
weather. They do not know the sea who
know her only when she is calm. She is most
beautiful when angry. Shall you tire of your
long voyage?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Uncle Andreas, I could sail for
ever."</p>

<p>The time passed pleasantly for Marco told
Zoe pleasant tales of their own beautiful Greece,
and her uncle told of rovings from shore to
shore. He had been a sailor for many years and
now owned his own sloop, in which he sailed
over the Mediterranean with cargoes of currants
and lemons. He had had many adventures,
had been shipwrecked upon one of the little
islands of the sea and in his youth had even
sailed to America.</p>

<p>"I do not believe that your father is dead,"
he said to Zoe one day. "He may have written
letters which you have never received, but I
think if he were dead we would have heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of it. Some day he will come back or we will
go and hunt him up."</p>

<p>Zoe's eyes grew large and tender.</p>

<p>"If my father would only come back," she
said, "I should never ask the saints for anything
so long as I live. But I know I will be
very happy with you and Aunt Angeliké."</p>

<p>"Especially as Marco will be there," laughed
her uncle, and Zoe laughed too.</p>

<p>"Marco has been so good to me that I would
be a strange girl could I be happy without
him," she said.</p>

<p>When they sailed into the Gulf of Athens and,
rounding the point, she saw the "City of Sails,"
as it is called from the many boats in the harbour,
the little girl could hardly contain herself.
She saw for the first time the wonderful marble
buildings of the city of Athens, with the Acropolis
and the Areopagus, where gleamed the
famous ruins of the Parthenon; and to the
child, her mind filled with the lore of the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ago, every marble was peopled with heroes,
every leaf and bud and bird sang of Pericles
and other famous Athenians, as Mt. Olympus
and Tempe's Vale had whispered of the gods
of old.</p>

<p>Athens is perhaps one of the most interesting
cities in the world. The ship anchored in the
harbour of Pireas and the three landed in a
small boat rowed by Uncle Andreas' stout sailors.
Then they drove in a cab between the long
rows of pepper trees, Zoe bouncing from one
window of the cab to the other in a frantic
effort to see both sides of the street at once.
The driver drove very fast, calling "Empros!"
to any passer who chanced to cross his path,
and Zoe wished he would go slowly so that she
might see all the wonderful things they passed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle, what is that?" she cried as
they passed a procession of men carrying
something on a bier.</p>

<p>"It is a funeral," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why isn't the coffin covered?" she asked,
for as they drew nearer she saw that there was
no cover and the dead man lay covered only
with flowers.</p>

<p>"The custom of burying the dead without
cover arose in the time of the first Turkish war,"
he said. "The Turks feared that soldiers
would get outside of the wall by pretending
to be dead and being carried out in coffins.
Several famous leaders got out of the city in
that manner and stirred up the country people
to revolt. So they made a law that people who
died must be carried through the streets uncovered
and a lid put on the coffin only as it
was lowered into the grave. Miserable Turks!"
and Uncle Andreas spat on the ground, as every
good Grecian does when mentioning the name
of his hated enemy. The Turks have always
coveted Greece and in the bitter wars between
the two countries has been bred a hatred
which does not die out as the countries grow
older.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Marco!" cried Zoe from the other
window, "See them cooking in the street!
I never heard of such a thing."</p>

<p>"That is quite common," said Marco. "It
is not good to have fire in the house, you know,
so men make their living by taking stoves
around from house to house and cooking whatever
people wish for dinner. You see many
of the houses are built without any chimneys
for the smoke, and when they have stoves in
them they have to let the smoke out through
a pane of the window. Often it blows back
into the room, and so people do not care for
stoves. Heat in the house is very bad for
the health, you know, so these travelling stove-men
make a good living."</p>

<p>"Nearly everything is brought to your door
in Athens," said Uncle Andreas. "The street
sellers peddle not only everything to eat, but
dry goods, notions, hats, shoes, and nearly
everything else, from trays hung around their
necks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly their cab stopped and drew up at
the edge of the sidewalk. Zoe wondered what
was the matter as she saw the driver take off
his cap, and her uncle exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Well, Zoe, you are in luck! Here comes
the royal carriage."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle, is it the King?" she cried,
bouncing up and down with excitement.</p>

<p>"His Majesty, the Queen and Prince Constantine,"
said her uncle as a handsome carriage
drove by. Zoe had a glimpse of a fine-looking
man, and a sweet-faced woman gave her a
bright smile. Then the cab drove on again
and she sat down with a gasp of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" she said. "Why, Uncle,
it was only a two-horse carriage, and there
wasn't any music or soldiers or crowns on their
heads or anything!" Her uncle and Marco
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"You are all mixed up, Little One," said
Marco. "Crowns on whose head&mdash;the horses?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Our king is the most democratic monarch in
Europe. He often walks around Athens without
any one with him at all. He is quite safe,
for every one likes him. He likes a joke and
does not care at all for fuss and ceremony.
They tell a story that one day he was out walking
and met an American, who stopped him
to ask if it was permitted to see the royal gardens.
Of course the American did not know
to whom he was talking, but the king said,
'Certainly, sir, I will show them to you;'
and he took him all around the gardens, talking
with him pleasantly and telling him many
interesting things about Athens. At last the
American said,</p>

<p>"'What kind of a woman is the queen?'</p>

<p>"'She is beautiful and good as she is beautiful,'
answered the king.</p>

<p>"'What about the king?' asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"'Oh, he isn't of much account,' said King
George. 'He hasn't done much for the country.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"'That's strange,' said the American. 'You
are the first person I have met in Greece who
did not speak well of the king.'</p>

<p>"'Indeed,' said the king with a laugh.
'Well, I know him better than most people.'
The man found out afterwards that he had
been talking to the king, and he was very much
astonished.</p>

<p>"When the king first came to reign," said
Uncle Andreas, "people thought he would
not be popular. He was a stranger, the son
of the King of Denmark, and brother of the
Queen of England, but he brought to our
country such a magnificent present that our
people felt kindly to him from the first. You
know the miserable Turks had taken away
from us the Ionian Isles, and England had
taken them from the Turks and ruled well
over them for the years in which they occupied
them. When the king came to us he
brought to us, a free gift, those beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
islands, the loss of which every Grecian had
mourned for years."</p>

<p>"It is no wonder people like him," said
Zoe. "I am so glad I saw him. He has such
a nice, kind face, and the queen is lovely."</p>

<p>"She gives much to the poor and is greatly
beloved," said Uncle Andreas.</p>

<p>"It should make her very happy to be surrounded
by so many who love her," said Zoe
softly.</p>

<p>"Angel of a child!" said her uncle. "You
shall never be unhappy again if I can help it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am very happy," she exclaimed.
"I was not unhappy at Marco's home, not
very," she added truthfully. "Only I wanted
my mother, and sometimes I wanted to be
where we had been together. I think there are
always things we miss, no matter where we are.
Now I shall be happy in my own dear Argolis,
but I shall still long for my mother and father,
and I shall miss the babycoula."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will have your cousin Petro to play
with," said her uncle. "He is about your age,
and will love you like a sister and tease you like
a brother. Come, I know that you and Marco
are thirsty. Let us stop here and take a cup
of coffee."</p>

<p>"That will be nice," said Zoe who had never
seen a coffee-house. They got out of the cab
in front of a little shop with little tables at which
sat a number of people. They sat down to
one of the tables and Zoe watched with delight
the making of the coffee. Grecian coffee is
made in a peculiar way. The coffee-machine
has a round brass cylinder which pulverizes
the beans till they are fine as powder. A teaspoonful
of powder is used to each cup, and the
powder is put in a brass dipper with an equal
quantity of sugar. To this is added boiling
water and the mixture is put over the fire until
it boils. Then it is beaten to a froth and boiled
again, beaten again, and boiled and beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
a third time, when it is a thick and delicious
syrup. It is said to contain all the good part
of the coffee, and taken in this manner not to
be injurious at all. In Greece it is taken in
great quantities, and this may account for the
fact that one almost never sees a drunken man
in Greece. Zoe sipped her coffee with delight
and ate the <i>loukoumi</i> and the handful of pistachio
nuts served with it. Then as they sat so
quietly, there came to Zoe the greatest excitement
of her life. Suddenly there was a great
commotion in the cafe; men jumped from
their seats, the waiters ran to the door, in the
street children shouted and waved their caps,
as a cab drove up and from it emerged a young
man. He was of medium height, dark-haired,
dark-eyed, with a strong, keen face and an air
of great simplicity, seeming rather abashed
at the shouts which rang through the air,</p>

<p>"Zito, Loues! Spiridione Loues!"</p>

<p>"Zoe, good fortune goes with you!" cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
her uncle. "It is Loues, the winner of the
Marathon," and he lifted her high in air to
see the hero. All Grecians rejoiced to see
him, for he had won the Marathon race, when
all the other prizes of the Olympian Games had
been won by Americans.</p>

<p>"Since the first Olympian Games," said
Marco, as the noise quieted down and Loues
was allowed to take his coffee in peace, "there
has never been such an excitement as there
was over Loues."</p>

<p>"Why do we have the Games?" asked
Zoe, who could not understand why there was
so much fuss over a young peasant whom she
thought not nearly so handsome as Marco.</p>

<p>"It comes from the days of ancient Greece,"
said Marco. "I will tell you of it while we
wait for your uncle, who must speak with a
friend over there on business.</p>

<p>"In the very old days when men worshipped
the gods, there was at Olympia a temple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Zeus, and here men gathered every year to do
him honour. The Greeks loved all manner of
sports. They wrestled, ran, jumped, and threw
the discus better than any people in the world.
Their bodies were strong and beautiful, as we
know from the wonderful statues which have
been kept in the museums. They loved beauty
so much that they did everything to keep their
bodies beautiful, fasting, exercising and loving
all fine, manly sports. So every four years
they had the Olympic Games; and men came
from all over Greece to try to win the prizes,
for to have the laurel wreath of victory at
Olympia placed upon his brow, was the highest
honour a man could wish. Envoys were sent
out early in the year of the games to invite
strangers to witness them, and people came
hither from many lands. The victors were
crowned and carried in procession with shouts
and hand-clapping, honoured by all.</p>

<p>"The games were stopped in the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Emperor Theodosius, because he thought them
too pagan, and he wished Grecians to put aside
pagan things and become Christians. They
were begun again in 1896, and now the King
takes great interest in them, and so does Prince
Constantine.</p>

<p>"Loues won the Marathon race, which is the
most exciting of any of the sports. Many,
many years ago the Persians were at war with
Greece. They had so many soldiers that the
Grecians felt certain that their enemy would
conquer, but they determined to fight to the
death. It was in the fifth century before Christ;
Darius, the Persian king, led one hundred
thousand men against Miltiades and the Athenians,
who numbered only ten thousand men,
and they fought a terrible battle on the plains
of Marathon. At home the wives and mothers,
the old men and children waited, feared and
trembled.</p>

<p>"'Is there no news from Marathon?' they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
asked each other. 'Is all lost?' But no
answer came. At last they saw a speck of dust
in the distance and they held their breath.
Was it defeat, dishonour, captivity, which came
flying to them from Marathon? None knew.
The speck came nearer and nearer, no speck
but the figure of a man, running as never man
ran before. Breathlessly they waited, no one
daring even to speak, as he dashed to the city
gates. White with dust he staggered within
the wall with one wild cry of 'Victory!' as
he fell fainting upon the ground. How men
honoured him, the fleet runner who had brought
the news from Marathon, where Darius' men
lay in mighty heaps of slain, and Greece was
free.</p>

<p>"So they made in honour of this victory the
Marathon race at the games, and Loues was
the proud winner, the prouder because all the
other contests, even our Grecian disc-throwing,
were won by men from America."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am so glad I have seen him," said Zoe.
"And thank you for telling me all about
it."</p>

<p>Then they started again on their drive and
found that the sun was setting. As they drove
to the inn where they were to spend the night,
he was clothing with a rosy glow Hymettus
and Penteligos, the two mountains on either
side of Athens. Then the glow faded and a deep
purple spread over the sky, deepening into violet.
Zoe thought she had never seen anything so
beautiful, and she sank to sleep that night,
tired but happy, murmuring to herself, "It
is my home, this lovely Greece of ours. How
glad I am that I am a Grecian."</p>

<p>The two days spent in Athens were full to the
brim with delight for Zoe. Her uncle seemed
to have money enough to spend freely, and
he bought her a new frock, a new hat, and&mdash;wonder
of delight! red shoes stitched in gold.
These came from Shoe Street, where all manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of shoes hung in pairs outside the small doorways
of the shops. Her uncle had some business to
attend to, and she and Marco wandered about
seeing the ruins of the ancient temples, with
their wonderful marbles and carvings, which
have made the Parthenon of Athens famous
all over the world.</p>

<p>The most wonderful things Zoe saw were the
peasant dances, and these she stumbled upon
quite by accident. Uncle Andreas had gone
out to a village north of Athens to attend to
some business and had taken Zoe with him.
On their way home they saw a crowd at a small
village through which they passed.</p>

<p>"I wonder what is happening here?" said
Zoe, and her uncle asked the driver of their
carriage.</p>

<p>"It is the time of the peasant dances," he
said. "If you have never seen them you should
stop, for they are very beautiful." So they
stopped the carriage and watched the dancing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
which was held on a smooth bit of green sward
outside the town. Men and maidens danced,
hand-in-hand, in long lines, with a slow, dignified
grace of motion, the men in <i>fustanellas</i>,
or some of them in plain European clothes,
but the women's clothes were the most beautiful
things Zoe had ever seen. Especially
lovely were three girls who danced particularly
well and were beautifully dressed. Round
and round they circled, in a slow, stately
movement, to the music of a drum, clarionet
and flute. The costumes of the girls were
loaded with embroidery, all the work of
their own fingers. Their dresses were white,
but the embroidery, which reached to nearly
a foot above the hems of the skirts, was
of coloured woolen, green, blue and gold in the
richest of designs. Over the skirts they wore
aprons, also embroidered, and sleeveless jackets
of white, with red borders embroidered with
gold thread. There were caps on their heads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
covered with veils which floated back and gave
a bride-like appearance to the dancers. Bangles
of gold and silver coins hung as necklaces
around their throats, and the driver explained
that these coins were the girls' dowries and
showed how much they were worth to the man
who married them.</p>

<p>"I should think anyone would be glad to
marry them without any dowry," said Zoe.
"They are so beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yes," said her uncle laughing. "But
even beauty has to be fed and clothed, and a
fair woman is fairer with a good marriage
portion."</p>

<p>At last came the day for their departure
and they were up and away on the ship, sailing
over the blue water.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we shall be in Argolis, and you
will see your new home, Zoe," said her uncle,
and she answered, "My old home, too, Uncle.
Thank you for bringing me back to it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>They reached the harbour as the moon was
rising in the sky, a slender, silver bow such
as Diana wielded in the forests of Ephesus.
A soft, hazy twilight breathed of fays and
nereids, and Zoe imagined that she heard them
laughing in the crested waves. She was tired
and very sleepy, and her uncle said,</p>

<p>"We shall soon be there, child, and your
aunt will be waiting for us with a good supper."</p>

<p>She smiled a little, but her footsteps lagged
as they walked up the steep village street.
Marco bent down to look at her face, then
he stooped and lifted her in his strong
arms.</p>

<p>"She is tired out. I will carry her," he said,
and Zoe heard nothing more, for her head fell
on his shoulder and she fell asleep, until a
kind voice said,</p>

<p>"Oh, Andreas, is that you?" Then two
warm arms were around her and a soft voice
said close to her ear, "Is this my little girl?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
She looked up to see a lovely woman's face
above hers; then she cuddled down in the
tender arms of Aunt Angeliké happier than
she had been since her mother died.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>BY THE SEA</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A month</span> in Argolis found Zoe rosy, happy
and quite unlike the sad-faced little maid who
had tended the babycoula in far-away Thessaly.
Uncle Andreas soon went to sea again, taking
Marco with him; but Aunt Angeliké was
kindness itself and Zoe's cousin, a merry boy
of ten, proved such a delightful playfellow
that the two soon became fast friends.</p>

<p>Their home was on a pleasant village street,
where a huge plane tree hundreds of years old
shaded the little balcony which extended from
the second story out over the street. Near-by
was the village fountain, a meeting place for
old and young, for all the water used for cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
had to be carried from the fountain in water-jars.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i129.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="people beneath a tree donkey in foreground" />
<div class="caption">"THEY WASHED BENEATH A HUGE PLANE TREE."</div>
</div>

<p>Aunt Angeliké was young and full of laughter.
She was much younger than her husband,
and seemed to Zoe almost like her cousin
Maria. She entered into everything the children
did, and added to their enjoyment by her
pleasure in their happiness. She made play
even of work, and Zoe enjoyed nothing more
than the family washing-day. This occurred
only once a month, but that was far oftener
than many of their neighbours washed their
household linen.</p>

<p>Aunt Angeliké went to the mountain stream
which gurgled down to the sea over rocks and
pebbles, clear and limpid, reflecting the blue
sky and white clouds.</p>

<p>They washed beneath a huge plane tree,
the largest one Zoe had ever seen, and about
whose trunk she and Petro together with arms
extended could not reach. The linen had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
brought up the hill on the back of a little
donkey which the children often rode. First
Aunt Angeliké soaked the clothes in lye water,
then boiled them and laid each piece upon the
stones to be beaten with a paddle.</p>

<p>"Now, Zoe and Petro, it is your time to help,"
she said laughing. "Beat them until they
are clean and white. Your uncle's <i>fustanellas</i>,
Child, take great pains with them. Of all
things they must be clean."</p>

<p>"I shall make them perfect," said Zoe,
"and Marco's also." And she beat and
paddled the skirts until they were as white
as the snow on Mount Olympus.</p>

<p>"There, that will do. Now spread them
out to dry," said Aunt Angeliké, and Zoe and
Petro laid the clothes about on the grass and
bushes, the <i>fustanellas</i> alone covering yards
and yards of the green.</p>

<p>"Let us rest," said Petro, throwing himself
down beneath the tree. "I am tired."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are a lazy one," said his mother,
seating herself beside him. "Next you will
want to eat."</p>

<p>"That I do," cried Petro, sitting up hastily
and forgetting his fatigue. "What have you,
little mother?"</p>

<p>"Now you are a greedy," said his mother,
laughing at him.</p>

<p>"But tell me," he said coaxingly, laying a
hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"Nay, Zoe is quiet and polite, she shall be
helped first," said the mother, and she drew
a basket of luncheon from its hiding-place
within the hollow trunk of a tree. There was
bread, cheese, olives and fresh <i>mousmoula</i>, the
most delicious of Grecian fruits, yellow as
gold, with four huge seeds within and a juice
cool and refreshing. They ate with health and
laughter for sauce, and then Zoe begged for a
story. "Just one, my aunt, before we take a
siesta."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall tell you of the good Saint Philip,"
said the aunt, who was very pious and thought
that children should always be told holy tales
to make them think of good things.</p>

<p>"St. Philip was always very sorry for the
poor. He was himself very good, and though
he had once had many <i>drachmas</i> he had given
away so much that he had hardly a <i>lepta</i>
left. He had even given away his food, and
kept for himself only a cow, living upon the
milk to keep himself from starving. One
night he slept and dreamed a strange dream.
He thought that he went to heaven and that
our Lord did not smile upon him. Instead
he turned away his face. But the great St.
Petro said, 'Our Lord, this is Felipo, lover of
the poor. Wilt thou greet him?' 'He loved
the poor, but himself he loved more,' said
our Lord with sadness, and St. Philip awoke
with a start. At that moment there came a
loud 'moo!' from without his hut, and he
jumped to his feet and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It is the cow! I have no need for a cow
when God's poor starve! I will kill her and
let the starving eat!' So with grief in his heart,
for he loved the animal dearly, he slaughtered
her and divided the meat among his poor.
That night he went to bed hungry, for he had
no milk for his supper, but his heart was full
of joy, for he felt the satisfaction of those who
'give to the poor and lend to the Lord.'</p>

<p>"He slept without dreaming and was awakened
in the morning by a familiar sound. It
was the 'moo moo' of his cow without his door,
and he said to himself, 'Of a truth I dream,
my poor cow is dead!' but again he heard
the call, 'Moo moo!' and he looked out of
the window. There stood his friend and
favourite, at the door of her little shed, awaiting
her morning meal. He could not believe
his eyes, but the cow was hungry and did not
at all like being left to stand at the door until
her master made up his mind that she was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a ghost. She stamped the ground with her
foot and mooed again, this time very loud.
'It is indeed she,' cried the saint. 'Now
is the good God good indeed! I have fed his
poor and he has rewarded me by restoring life to
my favourite. Always hereafter shall I believe
in his mercy.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a nice story!" cried Zoe, but
Petro said,</p>

<p>"If God could do anything, why didn't
He keep the cow from being killed. It must
have hurt her!"</p>

<p>"You are a heathen!" said his mother.
"You talk like an unbelieving Turk! Since
God can do anything He doubtless kept the
knife from hurting her when she was killed.
It is not well to talk so of the stories of the
saints."</p>

<p>"I like stories of battles better," said Petro,
still dissatisfied, but his mother said,</p>

<p>"I tell no more stories to boys who do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
like holy things, and now it is siesta time."
So they slept beneath the great tree, and all
was still, save the splash of the waterfall and
the hum of the bees, in the hearts of the scarlet
poppies. When they awoke it was late in the
afternoon and many of the clothes were already
dry.</p>

<p>"Let us go down to the beach and fish!"
said Petro.</p>

<p>"But you will fall in!" said his mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mother," said Petro. "But if I
do it will not hurt."</p>

<p>"Wait a little and I will go with you, that at
least I may be there to pull you out," said Aunt
Angeliké, laughing. She had not great faith
in her boy's promises, for she had lived with
him for ten years and knew that he was always
in head-first when there was any danger.
Petro was a gay little fellow&mdash;happy and full of
laughter, and he and Zoe played together always
pleasantly. So they ran about under the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
while Aunt Angeliké sorted her linen into
piles ready to pack upon the donkey's back
for their return.</p>

<p>"We shall catch a fish and roast him for
supper, then go back by moonlight," she said,
always ready to give the children pleasure,
and both thought the plan delightful.</p>

<p>"You can't catch me," shouted Petro as
he darted away from Zoe, and she chased
him about until both fell panting upon the
grass.</p>

<p>"See that boat," said Zoe. "How pretty
it looks! Its sails look like great wings spread
over the sea. Look! It is coming here!"</p>

<p>"No," said Petro. "I think it will anchor
and send in a boat. Yes, there come two men.
They have a fishing-net set here and are coming
to see what they have caught. See!"</p>

<p>Two sailors sprang from their boat on the
beach and started to haul in a seine. Zoe
gave one look at them and was off like an arrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
from a bow, crying, "Marco! It is Marco!"
Petro following not less quickly, calling,</p>

<p>"Father! We are here! Mother and I
are here!" The two men turned in astonishment
to see the two flying figures, and gay
Uncle Andreas cried,</p>

<p>"Beware, Marco! The Turks are upon us!"
As the two little folk hurled themselves into
the arms awaiting them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Marco, my own dear Marco! I am
so glad to see you! It is so long since you went
away!" cried Zoe, while Petro said,</p>

<p>"Were you coming home tonight? What
did you bring me?"</p>

<p>"We were coming home tonight to surprise
you, but it seems we are the ones to be surprised,"
said his father. "How came you here?"</p>

<p>"Mother brought the washing and we have
been here since morning," said Petro. "We
hoped to catch a fish for our supper and walk
home by moonlight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall do better than that," said his
father, as his mother came hastily down the
hill to greet them. "How would it please
you to eat one of my fish, when we have cooked
it, and then sail home with us in the boat?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" squealed Zoe.</p>

<p>"That will be fine!" cried Petro, but Aunt
Angeliké said,</p>

<p>"The fish and the supper, yes&mdash;but what
will we do with my white clothes and the
donkey?"</p>

<p>"We shall send the donkey home on his four
feet and the clothes on his back, both in charge
of one of my sailors," laughed kind Uncle
Andreas, and so it was settled.</p>

<p>They had a merry supper on the beach, and
the fresh <i>lithrini</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> made a delicious meal,
roasted over a fire laid on the stones. Other
good things were brought from the ship until
Zoe declared she had never seen such a feast.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<p>"Does she not look well, Marco?" said
Aunt Angeliké, and Marco replied,</p>

<p>"Like a different child. Naughty Zoe,
you did not like Thessaly!"</p>

<p>"But I like you," said Zoe sweetly, and
Uncle Andreas said teasingly,</p>

<p>"Thessaly! Who could like Thessaly! It
has been ruled by the Turks! Our Argolis
has never known the heel of the Unspeakable!"</p>

<p>"Then it was not worth their wanting,"
said Marco in return. "And Thessaly has
cast them out!"</p>

<p>"Do not quarrel," said Aunt Angeliké. "It
is all our own land and the sea is always ours."</p>

<p>So they started homeward over the dancing
waves, blue as heaven and as peaceful, and
Zoe's little heart was filled to the brim with
happiness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>AUTUMN PLEASURES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no lack of work in the little house
beneath the plane tree. Aunt Angeliké was a
busy housewife and cared not at all for drones
in her hive. She herself worked, and those with
her must work too, but she had a happy fashion
of making work seem like play. She knew
how to spin and to weave both cloth and carpet,
so her loom was kept busy with its cheerful
whirring. She also sewed and embroidered,
and all this useful handiwork she taught to
Zoe.</p>

<p>"Soon it will be fall, and you will go to
school," she said. "Now is the time to learn
things of the house. Girls should not learn
too much of books. It is not good for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
I knew a girl who could read hard books with
very long words, and what came of it? It made
her no fairer to look upon, and her father had
to give a large dowry to get her married. Often
I saw her at midday with a book in her hand
and the house not half neat. Do you think
it pleased her husband? His time was spent
in the coffee-house, where it was pleasant and
people talked instead of reading. It is best
for women to talk and spin and cook; these
things are of some account. Men cannot do
them, so leave to men the books."</p>

<p>So Zoe learned much and worked happily,
but played also. Petro was a delightful playmate,
and the two ran and raced in the sun,
happy and gay. To be sure they got into mischief.
Petro could think of more things to
do in a minute than poor little Zoe could in
an hour. She never intended to be naughty,
which, however, could not be said of her cousin.
He enjoyed more than anything finding out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
what would happen if he did things, and he
dragged Zoe with him into many a scrape,
knowing that he was not likely to be punished
if she was with him in any iniquity.</p>

<p>He was really the village mischief, but so
friendly a little chap, with such an engaging
smile for all the world that he seldom got his
deserts. To be sure, he was a kind-hearted boy,
and his mischief seldom hurt anybody. He
tied a bell to the wrong goat so that the herd
which brought milk to the village (for the goats
were milked in the streets every morning instead
of the milk being carried around in a
cart) went blindly after the bell-goat and
lost itself by going to the wrong stable.
Another day Petro persuaded Zoe to fish, and
left her to watch the lines while he went off
and forgot all about her in some new prank.
She caught a devil-fish, and as Petro had told
her on no account to let go of the line if she
had a bite, but to pull in as fast as she could,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
when she felt a pull at the hook she obediently
pulled in the horrid thing. Then she screamed
in fright.</p>

<p>"It is the Old Get Away From Here!"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
she screamed. "Petro! Petro!" Naughty
Petro was far away and did not hear. The
beast was black, with long legs which wriggled
and squirmed and sprawled over the sand
until she was sick with horror. It seemed like
a dozen snakes all joined to one body, and Zoe
had never seen anything so horrible. It tried
to reach the water, and the little girl thought
it was coming for her. She screamed again
in such an agony of fright that a man passing
ran to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>"It's surely the Old Get Away From Here
I have caught!" she cried. "Oh, please take
him off my hook and throw him back into the
sea."</p>

<p>"It is but a devil-fish, child," he said. "They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
are good to eat. I will take him off and kill
him for you, and you will then have a good
dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, I could not eat it!" said Zoe. "Thank
you ever so much," and she took her lines
and ran home to Aunt Angeliké. That good
woman threatened dire things to Petro, but
as he was not on hand to receive them she had
forgotten all about it when he did appear.
Truth to tell, Petro seldom received a back
judgment that was due him, for there was always
one right at hand, so that the past was overlooked.</p>

<p>The next scrape which overtook Zoe was of
a more serious nature. She and Petro had
gone one day to burn a candle in the little church,
it being Zoe's saint's day. This accomplished,
they sat down to rest under the great tree
which held the church bell. These tree
<i>campaniles</i> are often found in Greece and are
very quaint and pretty. The bell hangs aloft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
under a little wooden roof, and is rung by
means of a bell-rope which hangs down among
the branches.</p>


<p>It was hot and Zoe was tired with the long
walk up the hill.</p>

<p>"Let's take a little nap," she said to Petro.</p>

<p>"Very well!" said that youngster. If Zoe
had not been so sleepy she would have suspected
that Petro's unusual readiness to keep quiet
meant that he was planning to do something
especially naughty. But she merely thought
he was tired, and closing her eyes, was soon
sound asleep.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i147.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="girl under tree pulling rope" />
<div class="caption">"SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET, AND IN SO DOING PULLED THE BELL-ROPE."</div>
</div>

<p>No sooner was he sure of her slumbers than
Petro climbed up in the tree to see what the
great bell was like. He had always wanted
to do it but had never had a chance before. It
was not very exciting up there, however, and he
climbed down again. Then it occurred to
him that it would be interesting to tie Zoe up
with the bell-rope and see what she would do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
So very cautiously, for fear of waking her, he
tied the rope around her waist. Then he
thought better of it and tried to untie it, but
he had made the knot too tight and in working
at it he wakened Zoe. She sprang to her feet,
and in so doing pulled the bell-rope. The church
bell rang with a wild clamour, Papa Demetrios
came rushing from his house to see what was
the matter, after him came the <i>papadia</i><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and
all the children, while from the village a troop
of urchins, followed by older people, came
hastily up the hill.</p>

<p>"Is it a fire?" they called. "Has news
come from the king?" cried another. "What
is wrong in the village?" cried Papa Demetrios.
Nobody could give any answer to these
questions, and poor Zoe meanwhile rang the
bell louder and louder in her efforts to free
herself from the strange thing that bound her.
At last she tripped over the rope, fell, and sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in a heap on the ground, crying bitterly, but
otherwise quiet. So was the bell. So were all
the people. Then Papa Demetrios spoke
very sternly.</p>

<p>"What does all this mean?" Nobody answered,
for nobody knew. At last Petro spoke.</p>

<p>"If you please," he said in a low voice,
"I think it is my fault."</p>

<p>"Did you ring the bell?" demanded the
priest.</p>

<p>"No," said Petro. Then with an air of engaging
frankness, "but I caused Zoe to ring
it. You see, I tied her to the bell-rope."</p>

<p>"You are a&mdash;" Papa Demetrios' words
failed him. "I have said that the boy who
rang this bell should be whipped."</p>

<p>"Yes," Petro's tone was respectful, but his
eyes were dancing, "but Zoe is not a boy."</p>

<p>"That is true." The priest's face wore a
puzzled look. He glanced at Zoe, now standing
before him tear-stained and shame-faced; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
looked at Petro. Then memory took the kind
old priest back to the days when he himself
had been the village mischief, and Petro met
his eyes and found therein an answering gleam.</p>

<p>"You are a naughty boy!" said Papa Demetrios.
"But since you have told the truth and
not had the meanness to hide behind a girl,
you shall not be punished this time. Tell
your cousin that you are sorry for what you have
done to her, and beware that you do not touch
my rope again."</p>

<p>"Yes, your Grace," said the boy. "But
why do you let your rope hang down just
where any boy would want to ring it?"</p>

<p>"That I do not know," said the priest,
with again the twinkle in his eye. "I suppose
it is too much for meddlesome fingers. Hereafter
we shall remedy that." So he cut the
rope off so short that no one could reach it,
and he made a pole with a hook in the end
with which to reach it himself, which pole he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
kept in the priest's house, so that no boys rang
the church bell thereafter. And people went
back to their work, shaking their heads and
saying, "What will become of Petro Averoff?
He will grow up to be a vagabond." To which
one answered,</p>

<p>"Doubtless he will go to America, so it will
matter little!"</p>

<p>Aunt Angeliké was anything but pleased
with Petro's escapade and said severely,</p>

<p>"You are indeed a naughty boy. You shall
be punished by staying home tomorrow while
I take Zoe to the currant picking."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!" Petro's face fell.</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Angeliké!" cried Zoe. "Please
let him go! I would not enjoy it without him.
Besides&mdash;" she added in a whisper&mdash;"what
do you suppose he would do in mischief if you
left him behind?"</p>

<p>"God only knows," she responded. "Really,
I dare not leave him." But aloud she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
"Since your cousin insists, I shall take you,"
and Petro grinned, for the whispers had by no
means been lost to him.</p>

<p>The time of currants is one of the happiest
seasons for little Grecian children, for the fruit
is delicious and it hangs in great clusters upon
the bushes. The fruit is called "Corenth,"
named from the city of Corinth, and the currant
trade is among the best in Greece, over a
hundred and seventy tons being gathered each
year.</p>

<p>The currant bushes are planted in rows
three feet apart, like the Italian grape-vines,
and grow on a single stalk which is trimmed
down each year so that the roots may be
strengthened.</p>

<p>Shoots spring up in March and April, and by
the last of August the bushes are loaded with
fruit, light and dark varieties. Women break
the earth and heap it around the bushes during
the growing season, indeed, women do much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of the field work in Greece, and it seems to
agree with them, for Grecian women are nearly
always healthy, though this may be due to the
beautiful climate.</p>

<p>Both drought and rain are bad for the currant
crop, and the heavy winds often blow the fruit
off the bushes, but even with these drawbacks,
the currants are sent to England, America and
France, besides the Mediterranean countries,
and the finest currants in the world come
from Greece.</p>

<p>Zoe helped her aunt with the picking, for
Uncle Andreas owned a currant plot, and everybody
was needed to help get the fruit in after
it was ripe. It was a delightful outing into the
country for the little girl, and she enjoyed the
picking and the lunch in the open air, which
they ate seated upon blocks of white marble,
the ruins of what had once been a beautiful
temple. Petro was on his good behaviour and
did nothing worse than fall off a column and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
scratch his nose, and a fall from Petro was such
an everyday occurrence that no one, least of
all the boy himself, paid any attention to it.</p>

<p>"Well, child," said her aunt, as they went
homeward that night. "Have to-day's pleasures
made up for yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed. I have had a beautiful
time," said Zoe. "Thank you ever so much
for taking me to see the currant picking."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>A HAPPY EASTER</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Easter time. All through the winter
with its strict Lenten fast, Zoe had looked
forward to the feast, while Petro had kept the
fast days under his mother's strict supervision
until he said he was ready "to eat a lamb's
bones for Easter breakfast." All Grecians eat
lamb at Easter time, and from every house in
the village on Holy Saturday can be heard
the bleating of imprisoned sacrifices ready to
be slain for the morrow's festivities.</p>

<p>Uncle Andreas and Marco were to be at home
in the early morning, and Zoe was happy in
the thought of seeing them. The little house
was clean and neat, and Zoe with a light heart
followed Aunt Angeliké up the hill to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
church, whose bells called sleepily to the
midnight Mass.</p>

<p>Bright were the stars, and in the sky soft as
the ocean, the moon full and radiant in beauty.
The climb to the church at the top of the hill
was steep, but many of their friends were climbing
too, for all the villagers turned out to the
service, since no Grecian would willingly miss it.</p>

<p>They reached the open square before the
church just as the Mass began. Zoe entered
behind her aunt and kissed the <i>eikon</i> at the
door, taking from the server a long taper of
yellow wax and holding it unlighted, as did
everyone else. Then the priest came to the
altar carrying a lighted taper, and all the altar
boys, of whom Petro was one, scrambled
excitedly to see who could get his candle
lighted first. Petro was the lucky one, and it
was his proud duty to light the candles of the
waiting worshippers.</p>

<p>When all were lighted the priest led the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
procession, every one bearing his taper alight,
out into the square. Zoe thought she had never
seen anything so wonderful as the square all
aglow with dancing, flickering lights, in the
centre the catafalque of Christ draped in deepest
black. Upon this had been laid the cross with
the image of Christ sawed out of a flat board
with the face painted on it. The Greek Church
does not approve of the use of statues, taking
literally the verse of Scripture, "Thou shalt
not make unto thee any graven image," and
this painted figure is the nearest to an image
ever used in the Grecian churches.</p>

<p>The choir was singing their minor chants,
the censers were swinging back and forth in a
cloud of incense, the candles were flaring and
flickering. As soon as one went out a bystander
gave of his holy fire and it was relighted. One
by one the worshippers came forward, knelt
and kissed the cloth which covered the catafalque,
blessing themselves as Papa Demetrios<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
sprinkled them with holy water, and all
the time the strange, rhythmic chant of the choir
continued.</p>

<p>Zoe prayed earnestly and gave little heed
to the service, so that she did not notice that in
the crowd she was separated from her aunt.
It was nearly time for the close of the service
and she felt in her pocket to see if she had her
hard-boiled egg. It would be a dreadful thing
if she had forgotten it. But it was there, and
she smiled to herself that the happy day would
soon come.</p>

<p>All over Greece, in every province, thousands
of Grecians break a hard-boiled egg when the
bells ring on Easter morning, a custom which
has been handed down for centuries. The
Grecians say that one must always eat hard-boiled
eggs on Easter morning, and bowls of
them are found in every house on that day.
The custom arose in memory of a miracle
performed when the Turks ruled in Greece.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
A Turkish woman was carrying an apronful
of eggs on Easter day and was met by a Grecian
who politely saluted the infidel, "Christ is
risen!"</p>

<p>"Risen indeed!" said the unbeliever. "I
shall never believe that until these eggs in my
apron have turned red."</p>

<p>"Open thine apron and see!" said the Grecian,
blessing herself as she spoke, and lo!
the eggs were red as blood! The unbeliever
straightway believed, and from that day red
eggs have been eaten at Easter.</p>

<p>Suddenly Papa Demetrios raised his hand and
blessed the people, saying in a loud voice,
"Christos Aneste!" Immediately the bell-ringer
seized the bell-rope which hung from the
great tree beside the church, and rang the
bell in a wild and joyous clamour. All over
the land, far and near, other bells were rung,
and from every voice on the square went up
the glad shout, "Christ is risen! Christ is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
risen!" Boys threw torpedoes at the white
walls of the church and in the distance could
be heard the sound of guns and fire-crackers,
and everywhere was the wildest joy.</p>

<p>Zoe's taper suddenly went out.</p>

<p>"Aunt Angeliké," she said, "please light
my taper." Her aunt did not answer, and
looking hastily over her shoulder, Zoe saw that
she was not there and around her surged the
crowd. For a moment she was frightened, then
she said to herself,</p>

<p>"There is nothing to fear. I must not be
afraid. I shall soon find her," and she turned
here and there, but could find no trace at all
of her aunt.</p>

<p>"Can she have started home without me?"
she thought, and tried to reach the edge of the
crowd. Her foot caught against a branch of
olive thrown down, and she stumbled and would
have fallen had not a strong arm caught her.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," she cried as she struggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to her feet, to find herself in the grasp of a
bearded stranger who looked at her so strangely
that she wondered what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Your name, child, what is your name?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"My name is Zoe Averoff," she said. "I
must find my aunt. Please let me go." He
held her arm so tightly and looked at her so
strangely that she was frightened.</p>

<p>"I shall never let you go!" he exclaimed.
"Zoe! Zoe! do you not know me?" Something
in the voice seemed strangely familiar.
She looked into his face, into the dark eyes
which looked with such love and longing into
hers, then she gave a glad cry,</p>

<p>"My father! oh, my father!" and his arms
closed around her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Such a happy Easter!" said Aunt Angeliké,
as Sunday morning dawned clear and beautiful.
"My husband and Marco at home, Zoe's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
father come back to the child, Petro behaving
not worse than usual and the Easter lamb
roasting a perfect brown as I baste it with the
lemon dipped in lard."</p>

<p>"Was it not wonderful that my father found
me at Easter time?" said Zoe, a strangely
radiant Zoe, with shining eyes and brilliant
cheeks. "He had been ill for weeks in a strange
place they call Chicago. There he met a
Grecian from Argolis and from him he heard
that the news had come from Thessaly that
my mother and I were dead. At that he did
not want to return home, but he wrote several
times to Uncle Georgios to hear of us and had
no answer. Of course those letters never came.
At first he sold things from a little cart in the
streets. Then he saved money and with
another Grecian he had a shop with flowers
to sell. The Americans are strange people.
They have money to throw away! They buy
fruit and flowers all the time. Think of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
strange a country where one buys what here
one may take with but a 'thank you' for pay!
In the flower shop he made much money.
But he was always sad. The money was of
little good, since he had no one to share it with.
Then he grew very homesick. He wanted
once more to see Argolis and to sail on the blue
seas of Greece. So he sold his flowers to his
partner and took all his <i>drachmas</i> and returned
home. He thought to spend his Easter here
and go then to Thessaly to hear of my mother
and myself and how we came to die. Then
as Papa Demetrios said, 'Christ is risen!'
lo! there was I risen from the dead."</p>

<p>"I thought it was a miracle," said her father.
"For though the child is grown older, she is
just like the Zoe whom I left, and to see alive
her whom I thought dead was indeed a marvel."</p>

<p>"Shall you return to that far land?" asked
Uncle Andreas, "and take Zoe from us?"</p>

<p>"Not so," said Zoe's father. "I shall stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
here and have a fishing-boat, for home is best
and I think Zoe would not be happy so far
away."</p>

<p>"I am glad you will not take her from us,"
Aunt Angeliké said sweetly. "I have learned
to love her as my daughter."</p>

<p>"I am glad, too," said Marco, and Uncle
Andreas laid his hand upon her curls, saying,
"We all love the child."</p>

<p>Zoe smiled happily and nestled up to her
father.</p>

<p>"Such a happy, happy Easter," she said.
"I have nothing in all the world to wish for."</p>

<p>"Then wish for dinner," said Petro. "It
seems to me that lamb will never be done."</p>

<p>"You are a Turk!" said his mother, laughing,
and all laughed too, all except Petro, for
his mother had called him the very worst thing
which one can call our little Grecian Cousin.</p>

<div class='adtitle3'>The Little Colonel.</div>
<div class='copy'>(Trade Mark.)</div>

<p>The scene of this story is laid in Kentucky. Its heroine
is a small girl, who is known as the Little Colonel,
on account of her fancied resemblance to an old-school
Southern gentleman, whose fine estate and old family
are famous in the region.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>The Giant Scissors.</div>

<p>This is the story of Joyce and of her adventures
in France. Joyce is a great friend of the Little Colonel,
and in later volumes shares with her the delightful experiences
of the "House Party" and the "Holidays."</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>Two Little Knights of Kentucky.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Who Were the Little Colonel's Neighbors.</span></p>

<p>In this volume the Little Colonel returns to us like an
old friend, but with added grace and charm. She is
not, however, the central figure of the story, that place
being taken by the "two little knights."</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>Mildred's Inheritance.</div>

<p>A delightful little story of a lonely English girl who
comes to America and is befriended by a sympathetic
American family who are attracted by her beautiful
speaking voice. By means of this one gift she is enabled
to help a school-girl who has temporarily lost the
use of her eyes, and thus finally her life becomes a busy,
happy one.</p>

love and kindness to a knowledge of the right.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>The Story of Dago.</div>

<p>In this story Mrs. Johnston relates the story of Dago,
a pet monkey, owned jointly by two brothers. Dago
